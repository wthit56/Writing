					<p>I have a brand new story I'm working on, featuring a detective named Gadwell. I don't have any plans for this prose to turn up in the story, but it should give you an idea of who Detective Gadwell is and the world he lives in.
					<p>I'll be releasing the first few chapters, in first-draft form, to my <a title="Go to Thomas Giles&rsquo; Patreon page" href="http://www.patreon.com/thomasgiles" target="_blank">Patreon</a> supporters soon. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this snippet!</p>

				<p>Gadwell looked around at his apartment. Since graduation into the workforce of Montel-6 it had been home, though no photos perched in alcoves and no artwork hung on walls. All that seemed dull to him now, just as they said it would.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow, it would all be someone else&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;d take his clothes, his flat, his body&hellip; and he would take theirs. All he&rsquo;d take into his new life was the keys in his pocket and the watch on his wrist.</p>
				<p>He strode towards the door. Then, with a silent goodbye, he opened it and stepped out into the sunlight.</p>
