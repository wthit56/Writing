		prose("\n			The horses became uneasy as the pair neared the clearing. It had taken them five days to trek through the forest, its undergrowth dense through centuries of undisturbed leisure, its tendrils thick and cumbersome underfoot. Even the great horses of Ander found it hard to press onward through the foliage, and they did not have even those to carry them on their journey. The two riders had dismounted to gain better purchase on the forest floor, picking their way through the maze-like woods.\n			Jent looked up at the massive tree ahead of them, still visible through the dense canopy. The forest was well known for its giant trees, each with girth even a family of woodsmen could not encompass, and stretching so far in the air a ship could be built stem-to-stern in long, uncut planks cut from the tree. It was said that during the war for the Wide Sea of Prote half the forest was chopped down, each tree made into its own ship. Thanks fully Jent was born long after such troubled times.\n			But the tree at the middle of all this was even grander. It was the only landmark that could be seen through the thick, tightly-packed forest. It could be seen for the many miles the forest covered, and even beyond the woodland. Some said it was the beginning of the forest—of all forests of the world—the first tree that produced the first seed that gave birth to all living trees down to this day. The more eccentric even believed it gave birth to mankind itself.\n			Jent had never believed himself one for such superstitious mythery, but he had to admit that over the past few days, as they drew close to that ancient tree, there was a sense of wonder, of awe, that had grown within him. An electricity to the air; an excitement to the rustling of the leaves. He knew it was just his nerves—a cultivated fear of disturbing the giant tree that was instilled in him from a lad when he used to play among the trees—but even so, he was excited to give a final shake of the fist at that old life.\n			Jent glanced over at Alet, walking with his white stallion just ahead. He was a man of twenty years, though his skin was hardened and aged by the desert winds. Jent had decided the lad was all too attached to his horse, though that was to be expected of a plainsman. Wandering about such vast expanses of nothing but rocky grounds and bushels of mossy growth meant a horse was vital for survival, besides food and water. And the white stallions of the plainsmen were well known to be the best breed for desert riding.\n			Alet paused and looked back at Jent. “So what do you expect the tree will say to us when it meets man for the first time since our birthing into this world?” he said with a grin, flipping a fold of his white tunic back over his shoulder. He knew Jent was not a believer—not in the trees, not in anything—but he seemed to delight in taunting his guide on the subject.\n			“I expect nothing. This trip is money in my pocket, which you know all too well, Alet.” Jent was an older man, his hands hardened with the callouses of hard labour. He did not wear the holy whites the pilgrim had offered him. His was a practical, hard-wearing green affair, with a thick poncho, pulled up over his shoulders and draped down his back.\n			In his younger days, Jent would help chop down the great trees on the day of felling along with all the other boys of his village, hauling the monolithic trunk back to town for building and weapon-making, and then carving and whittling in the cold year’s end. Though he knew the money from such work would pay the way for every family in the village for the rest of the year, once he hit manhood he decided he’d had enough of the life. Holding to the rituals and superstitions all year round to appease the forest and take a single tree at the felling was tiresome and nonsensical. So much work and sacrifice to appease the spirits or gnomes or goodness-knows-what just so they could chop a tree? Why did they need the tree’s permission for chopping? Did you ask a hen for its egg, or a pig for its fat?\n			No, that life was not for him. His was to make his own way in this world; doing jobs in town, or taking letters out to the city and fetching decrees and summons from the crown back to the people of the village. He was no man of vision and belief, but one of seeing what was in front of him; one of practicality. If Alet hadn’t offered such reward as would fill his coin-purse for a year, he would not have come on this fool’s errand to begin with. Only thing was, Alet knew it was his money only that joined his guide to the expedition, and was relentless in his goading on the subject.\n			Jent looked particularly tired today—felt it too—not from the journey itself, but more the company. With a sigh, Jent faced forward once more, ignoring his employer while Alet chuckled quietly to himself, patting his white’s muzzle.\n			They were close. Jent could feel it now; almost like there was a faint smell to the air. It reminded him of his felling days, trekking through the forest to find a tree ripe for chopping. It smelled like the giant mosses of the Sazae Desert or the soft scent of an intricately-carved whittle. But it was more than that. There was an excitement to the air, though there was not so much as a breeze— but maybe that was it. The air was still, and the leaves overhead silent, as if in reverence for the great tree close by.\n			And suddenly they were in the clearing. The bright sun burned into their eyes and both men recoiled and scrunched their eyes shut, raising a hand to shield themselves from the light. It was hard to track the sun in the forest. Its thick canopy made judging time no more accurate than day or night, and even then night could easily be mistaken for an evening cloud passing by.\n			Steeling himself, Jent looked across the clearing. It was a good hundred yards or so to the tree, the ground in between them and the giant flat and dry. By the short shadows of the long, yellowing grasses that covered the ground, he could see that it was near midday now, the sun at its zenith and spitting hot coals upon the dry earth exposed to the summer sky. And there, in the very centre, stood the great and wondrous Aulk, father of forests. It was taller than even the tallest of forest trees, and rounder than could be chopped in a week of chopping. Impressive for a tree to grow so old and still be upright.\n			He glanced at his employer, who to his surprise had knelt on the ground and prostrated himself before the tree. Jent shook his head. “Come on, man. It’s big, but it’s still a tree…”\n			The man did not reply. Jent could hear a muffled, low murmur of reverence and prayer. Was he reciting some ancient proverb handed down through generations of plainsfolk, or just some awkward, drunken mutterings trying to find the words to express the awe he felt in the presence of the tree? Was there even any difference?\n			Jent dropped his horse’s reins and strode over to Alet. “Come on, man,” he said, as if reprimanding a child. “Stand up and look smart. The wonderous wood-elf pretending to be a giant tree doesn’t want to stare at your arse.” He dragged the smaller man to his feet and began straightening his white robes, now dusty from the dirt at his feet.\n			Alet stood shaking, knees weak and wobbling in-place. It was a wonder they didn’t just give way and let the man crumple to the ground once more. “But… the tree… its days are beyond number; its leaves are—”\n			“‘Its leaves are many and fruitful,’” Jent recited in a drone. “Yes, I know how it goes.” The old prayer was a simple children’s rhyme in the village, sung to keep the mind busy while the hands felled giants. They kept the traditions, but that’s all they had become to them; all the mysticism and magic bleached out of them through years of tired repetition. If every time they recited the words or performed the rites they cowered in fear and reverence, how would anything get done?\n			“Look,” said Jent, firmly. “It called you here, right?”\n			Alet raised his eyes to the heavens. “In a dream full of wond—”\n			“So it wants to speak to you about something, right?” Jent continued, ignoring him.\n			Alet raised his hands aloft, gesturing wildly. “The father of forests wishes to—”\n			“So go speak to him then!” Jent finished, giving the man a shove towards the giant tree in the middle of the clearing.\n			Alet looked back, sheepishly. “Bu— But the great Aulk demands—” he stammered.\n			“He demands an audience with you,” Jent said seriously. A silence hung in the air between them. “No matter who you are or what you did or what rituals you have and haven’t done, he wishes to speak to you; he has chosen you out of the myriads of human beings in this world to come speak to him; the first time he has spoken in centuries.” He glanced over at the looming tree. Its great shadow had slid across the ground as the sun passed overhead as if to shield them from the harsh light. “I don’t know if I believe you were given a vision, or if there is even any entity that could give it.” He looked back at Alet now, eyes sharp. “But I know that you believe it. If this tree is so powerful as to put images in people’s heads who sleep soundly a hundred miles away, then would it not welcome you with open arms?”\n			“So… you do believe, then?” Alet asked, tentatively.\n			Jent shrugged. “A long time ago, perhaps.” Memories of a hard day of work flashed through the older man’s mind. The grand family feast that accompanied the felling was always full of joy, of laughter… the satisfaction of a job well done. But that was a time long past. A life he had given up to venture forth and find his own place in this world. It was not regret that Jent felt. It was a simple sadness at what was and what could no longer be.\n			“Then… then I shall go at once,” Alet said brightly. “If an unbeliever such as yourself can brave facing a god, then so shall I!” And with that, he began pressing on towards the giant tree, Jent following close behind. Jent had led the young pilgrim through the dense forest. From here on, Alet would be <em>his</em> guide.\n			Though the yellow-white grasses were thick underfoot, the pair’s progress wasn’t hampered by the brush. As they strode across the clearing, the foliage seemed to make way for them, cowering out of the way of their legs. Jent knew, of course, that this was just his imagination. Too much talk of the ethereal, was all. A trick of the light, nothing more.\n			As they neared the tree’s base, the grassland seemed to stop short, leaving a particularly arid patch of dusty, hard earth surrounding their goal. Surely, the great Aulk, father of forests would be swathed in foliage, in flower and bush. But there was not so much as a vine or patch of moss on its bark. It was as though no plant wanted to touch it; too timid to approach their venerated ancestor.\n			“Tell me, Alet,” Jent said. “What of the lore of the Aulk?”\n			“Surely you have heard the stories and sung the songs, being a feller of trees?” Alet said, surprised at the question.\n			“Such things were long ago for me,” Jent replied. “And there was no understanding for most but meter and rhyme.” He stopped for a moment, examining the ground devoid of life. “Is there some legend that speaks to the plants recoiling from their maker?”\n			Alet stopped too now, and looked back at the clear line where the grasses ceased their march. “Maybe…” He looked deep in thought. Jent could see the man had no answer to the quandary. “Maybe the great Aulk will have an answer for you. Maybe that is why I have been called here; to fix some ill with the forest.”\n			Jent hadn’t thought of that. But if that were the case, why send for a mere mortal to fix the garden? Could the great Aulk not tend his own forest?\n			Alet continued his approach, skirting around the thick, waist-high roots that protruded from the soil. He approached the tree’s base and reached out a hand to the bark. As his fingers brushed the thick, callous skin of the tree, it seemed to give off a subtle groan that reverberated through the ground underfoot, as if wakened from a millennia-long slumber.\n			The breeze picked up now, leaves stirring in kind. The sudden return of the ambient noises of the forest made him uneasy. He was used to the creaking of old timber, the loud whisper of leaves and the crunch of the underbrush. But something felt off about the sound now… something that put him on edge.\n			“Oh!” Alet yelped, jumping back from the tree.\n			Jent looked back at the bark where there had now appeared the smallest of seams, just visible in the craggy bark, stretching from half-way up the giant trunk all the way down to the clearing floor. As he watched, the seam broke at the ground, each side of the tree’s ancient bark pulling back and revealing a dark opening in its side.\n			Alet fell to the ground, bowing and grovelling as before and muttering his prayers. Stepping over him, Jent continued on to the opening, eyes darting about, looking for any hidden traps or dangers. There was only shadow, but a shadow so thick nothing of the inside could be seen at all.\n			“Well,” Jent said. “Looks all clear to me. Best get in there and get started.”\n			He looked down at Alet, still in his trance-like praying position. Jent kicked him lightly with a boot. “Come on, man. I’ve spent five days on this fool’s errand already; don’t make me wait ten to see my family once more.”\n			Alet’s head raised at this. “You have a family?”\n			“That is beside the point,” Jent replied curtly, grabbing hold of the younger man by his robes and dragging him to a standing position. The first time had taken its toll on his old bones, however, and he groaned with the effort this time. “If you’re going to commune with the Aulk, then I suggest you get on with it before I leave you behind in this place!” And with that, he patted the younger man on the back, jolting him toward the tree’s shadows.\n			The darkness seemed to reach out for Alet, dragging him into the tree. Instantly, he was engulfed in the shadows; swallowed whole and completely invisible from the outside. It almost looked like the shadows were alive; writhing about as they gobbled up the sacrificial lamb. Jent took a step back, eyeing the tree’s gaping hole suspiciously, ready to draw the shortsword at his belt—though what could steel do if darkness itself moved to take you?\n			Jent watched as the seam slowly knitted itself, drawing together first the top sides of the bark, and working its way down, until the tree’s entrance was completely hidden once again. Steeling himself, Jent stepped forward and felt at the bark to find there was no sign of the seam that was there but moments ago. Was this truly magic, like in the fairy tales the woodsmen told when they were kids?\n			The guide shook his head, turning around and taking three long strides away from the trunk. When it opened—<em>if</em> it opened—he didn’t want to be within the clutches of the shadow that lurked within. He spun on his heel to face the tree once more and sunk to the ground, crossing his legs beneath him.\n			And he waited. He stared intently at the giant for the first ten minutes, then playing with the long grass for the second, and resorting to picking at his nails and teeth for the third. He then stood and marched back to the horses, who quietly scrunched on the abundant grass underfoot. Pulling at the drawstring that kept his saddlebags closed, he rummaged around their contents until finally he produced a bottle. Taking a swig from the bottle, he felt the liquid’s spark warm his belly and bones as he started back to his position in front of the tree.\n			The day drew long and the skies had lost their luminance; the night chill would be setting in soon. The drink would help him keep warm. That and he was scared stiff of the tree, stomach churning in worry about the pilgrim and what unearthly thing might be happening to him right now.\n			In an instant the tree split in two once again, but this time it seemed to break further, too far for the ancient trunk to bear. The shadow spilled forth from within, as if moving to come out of the trunk and into the clearing. In amongst the writhing black mass, Jent could see the body of Alet, floating within, barely visible in the chaos. Jent moved back as the shadow pushed further and further until it was no longer held within the walls of the giant Aulk, standing apart from it as its own entity entirely. With a glance behind the cloud, Jent could see the tree itself wither and collapse, as if it was still standing only to house the entity.\n			“What—” Jent muttered in horror. “What have you done to him?” The kid was Jent’s next meal—his next <em>month</em> of meals—but as the two had spent the past week together, he had come to mean more to Jent than a simple employer.\n			The inky cloud swarmed angrily at this. Was this it? Was Jent’s fate to be swallowed whole by an evil black fog, knees shaking, breath shallow and wheezing? He’d left his old life behind to find adventure; to give him something to live and die for. But in the end, he would have no dramatic final words or heroic deed to be remembered for. The tree had breathed, and so he would die.\n			Closing his eyes, Jent dropped the bottle and stretched out his arms wide. “Then take me, if you must!” he cried bitterly. A feeble gesture, but he wouldn’t die scared and alone without squeezing out some legend first.\n			But nothing happened. He opened one eye, and then the other. As he watched, the shadow seemed to recede from Alet’s body, leaving him standing before the woodsman and disappearing off behind him. Alet’s eyes were still closed, seemingly unconscious from his ordeal but somehow managing to stay standing.\n			“A— Alet?” Jent probed.\n			The younger man took in a deep breath at the sound of his name, chest heaving as if taking the first breath in his life. The last wisps of darkness flitted away and the evening clouds seemed to part a little, lighting up the clearing once more. The man’s eyelids fluttered open, revealing eyes that seemed to give off a white mist, a light emanating from within. He looked at Jent, and a grin formed on his face.\n			“You may call me Aulk,” he said.\n			“Aulk?” Jent muttered. “But <em>that’s</em>…” He pointed behind Alet, but saw that the tree was disintegrating now, thick bark charring and crumbling away, branches sagging to the ground. Beneath its once grand canopy, the very ground seemed to shiver, dust rising into the air, rejecting what was left of the giant tree. “Alet? What’s going on?” Jent said, shakily.\n			Alet shook his head, slowly. “The tree was a good storage site, but time is running out—”\n			“But the tree… it’s crumbling away, being eaten up by some dark force—”\n			“Do not fear, Jent,” Alet said. “The tree was sustained by me over the centuries since our arrival. But I have moved on now, and so it cannot maintain its current size.”\n			“So you are the spirit that lived in the tree, is that right?” Jent said. A shadow of something flickered on Alet’s face. Fear? Contempt? “And now you’ve taken my friend’s body. Is that why you called him here?” He grew indignant, now. “He obeyed your beckoning; travelled hundreds of miles and paid me good money just to reach you, and yet you snuff out his life like a candle’s flame? Is this how a god rewards his loyal followers?”\n			Alet’s hand raised, gesturing for quiet. Jent grew silent and stared into Aulk’s eyes; the eyes that were once Alet’s. They gave off a white mist, a light made tangible wafting away in the light breeze. “Your friend is alive,” Aulk said.\n			“Then give him back to me!” Jent yelled, hand moving to his sheathed sword. Aulk glanced down at the sword, and looked worried for a moment. Was a god like this so afraid of mortal instruments of violence? “Now!” Jent commanded, gripping the sword’s hilt firmly, readying to unsheathe it at a moment’s notice.\n			Aulk silently closed his eyes, and his head sagged a little. Then in an instant, his eyes were open again. He breathed in deeply, sucking in air as if he hadn't breathed for a year, eyes wide in fear and confusion. “Wha— What’s going on? Jent?”\n			“Alet!” Jent yelled, reaching out towards his friend. But as soon as he did so, Alet’s eyes were closed again, head bowed and breathing calm.\n			“You see, I am not a monster,” a voice said, though no longer the light tones of Alet. “I am not a demon of the night set to steal the bodies of mortal men.” Aulk opened his eyes once more and looked at Jent, who moved back once again.\n			“But you—” Jent said desperately. “You can’t—”\n			“It seems I can, woodsman,” Aulk snapped in reply. Was the tree taunting him? Aulk looked down and then glanced back at the tree behind him. “And it is fortunate I am able to do so… for your sake.”\n			“For <em>my</em> sake?” Jent shouted. “Why in the stars would I want you to take another man’s body away from him?”\n			Aulk turned back to face the man, though still staring at the long grasses around them, and sighed. “It seems I am the only one left intact over these past thousand years. The others have forgotten who they are, and now roam this planet freely, seeking meaning and the real truth.” He looked up now, staring deep into Jent’s eyes. “But they will not find it. Men will seek to control them, Jent. It is in man’s nature to dominate and control, and with the power the others will afford them, they will be unstoppable to any conventional defences.”\n			“What— What are you talking about?” Jent asked.\n			“Magic,” Aulk answered.\n			“Oh. Right,” Jent said sarcastically. “Just like all the rituals and prayers we offered up as children. Sorry if I don’t grovel on the floor like the good pilgrim there, but fairy stories didn't so me any good then, and they do me no service now!” The woodsman breathed heavily, and could feel his cheeks grow hot. Was this simple goad so abhorrent as to stir rage within him?\n			Aulk stared at the man, unmoving. He seemed to be paused in thought, though somehow his whole face and body was still as stone. What was he waiting for? Wasn’t he going to respond? Jent opened his mouth to continue, when the tree father spoke in reply.\n			“I required no rituals,” Aulk said, calmly.\n			“But the village— everyone performs the rites before leaving for the felling. You must know what goes on in your own forest!”\n			“Yes, I have just caught myself up with—” Aulk responded, but then realised what the man in front of him had said. “But this is not <em>my</em> forest.”\n			“Not your forest?” Jent said angrily. “You’re the <em>father</em> of forests. <em>All</em> forests are yours!”\n			“I thought you didn’t believe in magic?”\n			Jent was taken aback by this. He looked away from the other man, trying to think. Was it really so hard to rid himself of the beliefs and superstitions of his childhood? How long had it been since he had left? Twenty years of no ritual and superstition, and no calamity or curse appearing in the night, should have sufficed for him to know there was no such thing as magic. “I— I don’t,” he mumbled glancing away from the tree’s belittling stare.\n			“Then how am I here?” Aulk asked.\n			Jent shook his head, confused.\n			“How was I in the tree for millennia before stepping out into the world once more?”\n			Jent stumbled back a step, hands covering his eyes, trying to get a grip on himself. This—all of this—it couldn’t be real. He’d lived his life the way he wanted to because none of this stuff <em>was</em> real. Could he have been wrong all these years?\n			“How did the bark split? And the shadow pull in your friend? How do I speak through his body now? How—”\n			“It’s a trick!” Jent snapped, still averting his gaze from the other man, half scared of a scolding retaliation.\n			Aulk smiled. “That’s right,” he said with a nod.\n			Jent felt a surge of confidence. “So are you the great Aulk, or is it a trick?” he said. “It cannot be both.” Aulk did not respond to this. “You’ve been stuck in a tree since the creation of worlds! Was that an illusion too, or were you tricked into such a prison?”\n			Aulk shrugged. “I was not imprisoned there. I chose the tree as a respite to wait out the development of your kind until a suitable juncture. The juncture has come, and so I am here. And so <em>you</em> are here.”\n			“But you were cramped and confined. Did you hold your breath all this time to survive in such a place?”\n			“A trick such as myself has no need of sunlight and fresh air.”\n			“You mean a <em>trickster</em>…”\n			“A trick, I said!” Aulk said, indignantly. “I am no trickster, but a trick!” He sighed and calmed his breathing, before continuing. “Long ago, in a time before your kind walked the world, other men in another place, far away, created a form of magic. They could fly, and swim beneath the waves without the need to breathe… even travel beyond the stars, racing light itself. And then they came to this place.”\n			“What happened to them?” Jent insisted. “Why did they leave?”\n			“They could not live here. There is too much nitrogen in the atmosphere, not enough carbon dioxide, and other factors made it impossible—” He paused in thought for a moment. “The air is mixed… not to their taste,” he corrected.\n			“The air is mixed? Like a broth of stew?”\n			Aulk rolled his eyes, looking around awkwardly. “It was mixed long ago in the forming of the world. And the other men could not undo it and change it to their liking, for their magic was all <em>trickery</em>. So instead they made you, so that you may bring life to this world.”\n			“And what of <em>our</em> magic?” Jent asked. “The gods and demons and fairy folk?”\n			“A different kind of trickery, but one so ancient, so pervasive that no one remembers it so.”\n			“But the other men… they created us. How can they be gods to make another man out of nothing?”\n			Aulk shook his head with a sigh. “They are not gods, and they did not make you out of nothing. Such feats are still beyond them even for all their trickery and magic. The closest they have come to true creation is us, the interfaces.”\n			Jent’s voice grew hushed. “The Many Faces, of old? You are one of the Faces of the Heavens?” He felt a heat in the pit of his stomach grow, his knees weakening and threatening to collapse entirely. He would not be tricked so easily. Such things were myth and legend, not fact. But was this really one of the Faces?\n			Aulk looked confused at this, not understanding. He glanced away and grew still once more. So still his eyes did not twitch nor his arms sway. What was he doing? Was it some sort of sickness that made him freeze so? Could the Faces even grow sick?\n			“Ah. I see,” Aulk said, breaking out of his stupor. “The world was made by the old gods and finally they created the many faces in the sky to save man from themselves…” he recited. Jent recognized it as one of the oldest scriptures, handed down from the time of making. Aulk looked back at Jent now, the quizzical look back on his face. “Is that correct?”\n			How does one of the Faces not know who he is? “Yes, great one,” Jent said reverently, starting to bow.\n			Aulk put a hand on the man’s shoulder to stop him. “Do not bow to me, Jent. The Faces from antiquity are but servants of the other men… servants of you.”\n			“No.” Jent shook his head. “No, that can’t be. You are a divine force, born of the creator, and I am but a—”\n			“I am a <em>trick</em>, remember? All magic is trickery. The Faces are trickery; artificial beings that cannot speak or move or do anything useful without a physical terminal— We are impotent, useless things by ourselves. Simple bodiless thinking machines. We cannot act unless others allow us to do so.”\n			“But the shadow! You reached out and—”\n			“The shadow?” Aulk looked puzzled. “Ah. You mean the nanites. Machines made by the other men, so small you cannot see one by itself… I suppose a cloud of them could look like a shadowy figure moving this way and that.” He sighed. “But I can see you do not understand. All you need know is that me and my fellow interfaces were created by the other men from far away. So were the nanites; the cloud of shadow as you put it. Our charge is to protect you from things to come, from the end of the world… and to protect you from yourselves.”\n			Jent felt the wind go out of his body. This was all too much to take in. Though he had decided the myths and magics of beforetime were nothing to him, he had never believed—never <em>knew</em>—those things to be false. How did the sun rise without the creators say so? How did the plants grow without the Faces beckoning them sprout from the ground? The mundane world could not exist without the divine. How could he live knowing there is no higher purpose… no higher purpose for his living?\n			Jent dropped to his knees, reaching down his hands to stop himself from collapsing entirely.\n			“Jent,” a voice spoke from above. “It’s okay.” The voice was softer now… more human. Jent looked up slowly to see eyes he had grown familiar with, no longer obscured by the white light.\n			“Alet?” Jent whispered.\n			“Everything’s okay,” Alet said, hunching over now at the woodsman’s side. “It’s all according to the divine plan. I was given a vision, Jent. Of you. Of this place. I followed it to find the great Aulk, father of forests.” Alet smiled now. “I have found what I sought. Have you?”\n			“But… why?” Jent said, trembling. “Why us? Why now?”\n			Alet straightened, and with a blink Aulk was back. “Alet is a believer. He does not know all that I have told you— cannot know, or else it may destroy him. He <em>knows</em> the gods are real. He knows magic exists. He was one of the few who would believe such a vision as I gave him and follow it with no doubt of its source. He was the closest of the believers; close enough to mean he would arrive before it was too late. It pains me to say so, but I had to use him.\n			“The other Faces are stirring. Many have forgotten themselves, forgotten their charge… forgotten their place. I fear there will be new and terrible gods born to this world… mighty warlocks and wizards given power to do with as they please. Magic is being reborn in this world. The tiny machines are capable of many powerful things; tricks with the power to heal and build… to conquer and destroy. Those of us that are left with their duty intact must work to fight against the dark ones. To save mankind from themselves and the lost Faces.”\n			So the magic of old was coming back. The Machines of Nan were powerful indeed to not be seen and yet be commanded to build up and tear down. Stories and tricks made real… how could the world survive such power?\n			“And me?” Jent said, calmly.\n			“You do not believe in the stories. You have chosen for yourself a life of hardship, away from from friends and family. You cannot bear to live a lie, and that is rarer than you might think among your kind. Even your sages and prophets are not as pious as they may seem. Your friend, my speaker, Alet, truly believes, more than any of those seeking fame and fortune through their faith.\n			“And you too are just as rare, perhaps even more precious. You can see things for what they are, even when it causes you heartache. You sacrifice yourself for the truth. I only hope the other sane Faces find similar men to lead them across this world to do what must be done.”\n			“And what <em>is</em> to be done?” Jent asked. “You will wait in Alet, I will lead him around and protect him from danger… But how could I protect him against other men with some awesome power? Against the end of the world?”\n			“You must use my guidance, and the power of the nanites now living within Alet, to protect yourselves and others in the times to come,” Aulk said, sadly. “Or the Faces, by their will or others’… will see this world burn.”\n			Was this really his lot in life? Was this how it would end, trying to stem the tide of desolation that is surely too great to master? And how was he to train his friend in an art never conceived of in all the world? His task was simply one last, hopeless thrashing against the inevitable chaos before the void claims them all…\n			“Once I have found one of my wayward brethren, I will speak to you again. For now though, I leave Alet in your charge.” Aulk stood up straight, as if saluting the woodsman. “Good day, sir,” he said with a short bow. “And may it go well with you.”\n			At that, the white mist floated away once more, and Alet was left standing in front of his guide. “Oh. Er…” He looked this way and that, trying to remember where he was as if waking from a fitful dream. “Ah. Jent. I gather the great Aulk has departed from me. I cannot feel him any longer.”\n			“What did he say, Jent?” Alet continued, following the older man as he stood and walked back to his dropped bottle. “Did he say anything about me? Did he speak any prophecy?”\n			“How about all of the above?” Jent said gruffly. Picking up the drink, he poured the last remaining drops down his throat.\n			“Oh!” Alet said excitedly. “You must tell me everything!”\n			Jent sighed and started towards the horses. He wasn’t getting paid enough.\n		")

	content: [
		prose("\n			“Jack? Are you alright?” The calming voice resonated around the room, invisible speakers throwing the sound from beyond the walls’ surface.\n			Jack didn’t respond. He sat on his bed, knees tucked up in front of him, arms wrapped around his legs and head buried in his arms. He felt hot. Despite coming in from the wintery cold of the world outside only minutes ago, his cheeks were flushed and his palms felt sweaty. He hated it when that happened. He looked like a beetroot; he just knew it.\n			“Jack… are you crying?” The deep voice was soothing, like a proud parent coddling a newborn baby. But he wasn’t a baby. He didn’t need a hug. <em>Oh what I wouldn’t do for a hug…</em>\n			“‘M not,” Jack barked, voice muffled.\n			“Come on, Jack,” the soothing voice said. “Please tell me what happened.”\n			Jack poked his head up to glare around his room. It was big for a bedroom, though most of the walls were taken up with storage, making the place feel cramped and uncomfortable. Sometimes it seemed his parents kept all their junk in his room. Was he just storage space to them?\n			“Oh, Art,” Jack mumbled to the open air. “We had Sculpture again. I <em>hate</em> Sculpture.”\n			Artifice—“Art” for short—was a computer program, an Artificial Intelligence, made to tutor, encourage… cover all the bases in case the <em>realonly</em> parents didn’t do a great job of raising their own kid. Jack’s parents relied all-too heavily on the AI in Jack’s opinion. Though he had to admit, Art was his best friend in the whole world. His friend…\n			“But you love to sculpt,” Art said.\n			“Here, yes. At <em>school</em>? I just… I can’t…” Jack struggled for the words. “They hate me,” he mumbled bitterly.\n			“They don’t know you like I do,” Art said. “They haven’t seen you when you’re sculpting.”\n			“Yeah?” Jack said, raising his voice. “Well maybe if I could use the interface like a <em>normal human being</em>—”\n			“You don’t need the interface to create—”\n			“They make worlds come alive! Generate creatures that move and talk! You haven’t seen them. You don’t know.” A silence hung awkwardly in the room. It wasn’t Artifice’s fault. He shouldn’t have taken it out on him.\n			“I’m sorry,” Jack mumbled, wiping the last tears from his eyes.\n			“The other children can push buttons,” Art said, calm as ever. “But can they make anything with their own two hands? I have seen you make beautiful, wonderful things.”\n			“Static things,” Jack said, sadly.\n			The walls shifted hue, slowly. The shift was subtle, designed to encourage a certain response from the room’s occupants. Instead of the cool greens and blues, the walls now sported a reddish hue like a setting sun.\n			“Tell me,” Art said. There was a tone to his voice of… excitement? What was he planning? “What was today’s assignment?” he asked.\n			“To build a boat. The lazy ones just made rowboats, but the others made speedboats.”\n			“And what were <em>you</em> going to make?” Art prompted.\n			Jack felt a grin form on his face. “I was going to make a pirate ship. Like in the movies. With cannons and a plank and a crow’s nest… But I couldn’t do it! The tools just don’t work right for me; I can’t <em>feel</em> them in my hands—”\n			“Okay, okay,” Art said soothingly. “So let’s make a pirate ship.”\n			“But we don’t have—”\n			“You don’t <em>need</em> the software. You have creativity. You have ability. You can make whatever you like.”\n			“But… I don’t—”\n			“Now get up and fetch some clay, would you?”\n			“What—”\n			“If you please?” Art said sternly.\n			Jack’s shoulders sagged and with a sigh he flicked his legs out off of the bed and stood up. “Yeah, yeah…” he mumbled, as he shuffled out of the room.\n\n			“So. Today we have a special treat,” Mrs. Crane announced to the class. The chatter quietened at this, the kids shoving their bags under the table, their eyes glistening in anticipation. “You have learned how to shape the virtual clay using the add and subtract functions. And last week we learned how to paint and animate it with the interface. Today we will be going to the holosuite to see how it’s <em>really</em> done.”\n			A cheer erupted from the class, kids shouting and talking excitedly amongst themselves. Jack waited for the cacophony to subside. The other kids in the class had joined because Sculpture was booked for the most holo time of all the lessons. They hoped for adventures and RPGs and, sometimes, they got them.\n			But Jack wasn’t there for the suite. He was there for the sculpting. It was all he had done in the school holidays before joining the senior school, and it had quickly become his passion in lieu of friends coming over to play or parents taking him out. He hoped there would be some actual sculpture to look at; something really beautiful and captivating. Of course, the others would hate it, but at least he’d actually be able to participate.\n			“So everyone pack up their bags and form a line outside,” the teacher called over the chaos.\n			The class lined up in the corridor and then followed the teacher over to the holosuite over the other side of the school. Then, while Mrs. Crane gave a speech about safety inside a virtual environment for insurance reasons—don’t jump off cliffs, don’t get your head stuck in railings and so forth—the kids shuffled themselves into a haphazard line, Jack joining quietly at the back.\n			Once the script was finished, Mrs. Crane looked up, stepping to the side to look down the line at her students. “Jack? Jack Brown, where are you?”\n			<em>Me? What does she want for?</em> Jack wondered.me He stepped out of line reluctantly. “Here miss,” he mumbled.\n			“Ah! There you are. There’s a space up here for you my dear.”\n			<em>The front?</em> He didn’t like the idea of going round with the cool kids almost as much as they didn’t want him there.\n			“That means come here, Mr. Brown,” she called.\n			His head dropping, Jack shuffled towards the first group. He could feel everyone’s eyes staring as he went.\n			“Okay. Good lad,” she said, before turning and entering in a few commands to the interface that hovered in-front of the door. “Now… ready? And… go!” She gave the door a quick shove and the ten or so students in front of Jack bolted through the opening in an instant. Jack followed sullenly into the chamber.\n\n			The room was dark at first but, as soon as the door was shut and bolted, the program began. The sound of seagulls and crashing waves. The creak of wood beams. The flap of canvas sails straining against the strong sea wind.\n			The lights came up, and they were there. A grand pirate ship rocked and shuddered beneath their feet as it forced its way through the waves. Jack stepped out onto the deck, staring in wonder at the ship. He examined the detailed carving and felt the woodwork. Tentatively, he stepped forward and held the ship’s wheel.\n			It was his! The whole ship was his! The pirate ship he made with Art almost a week ago… it was real. It moved, it creaked… it interacted. It was better than he’d ever dreamed of.\n			“Your tutor sent it to me, Jack,” the teacher said behind him, softly. “He said you’d made it with your bare hands and he helped you with the interface work. He sent me the file, I had a look, and… it’s simply amazing. I’ve never seen anything like it; not from a student. Never something so detailed and grand.” Her eyes shone in wonder as she stared at the open sea and the magnificent ship in front of them.\n			“But how—” Jack asked, spinning round on his heel.\n			“He emailed me,” Mrs. Crane said. “Asked me for my opinion as your Sculpture teacher. Jack, I never knew you had such a talent!”\n			Jack turned and stared across at the ship before him; ten cannons on each side, the swaying ropes and pulleys… “But I only made a little clay sculpture,” he mumbled. “I can’t do any of the interface things like the others can.”\n			“Oh, my dear boy,” the teacher mused. “That’s the hard part. Pushing buttons isn’t what makes art; it’s the original material that takes talent. It’ll take the others the rest of their school careers to approach your level of skill. I’m sorry I never noticed you worked better with the real stuff than in virtual space, but… you’re gifted, Jack. And I’d be more than happy to help you with the rest, if your tutor is okay with that. With time, and practice… you’ll take the world by storm.”\n			Jack reached up and gripped the wheel once more. He felt the wind on his face, smelled the faint sea salt on the breeze. <em>So this is what it feels like to be home.</em>\n		")

		prose("\n			Captain James Sidler sat on the observation deck, staring out at the cloud. The Explorer-class vessel was making its first pass around the anomaly, the fifty-two members that made up the rest of the crew doing all the usual spectrograms and positional scans, but he preferred to down sit here with a nice cup of green tea and watch in peace.\n			With the cryostasis chambers now built-in to every long haul ship, it seemed every moment of wakefulness was full of activity. One minute they were preparing for launch, making final checks on course headings and making sure valves and checks for the freezers were all in working order. And then the next they were here, at their destination, with scans to make and data to analyse, sending it back until command sent the next orders. And then they were back in the freezer again for the cycle to restart.\n			Space exploration was supposed to be fun, wasn’t it? Finding new planets and new species, sneaking around virgin space and trying to not get caught by any alien super-beings that didn’t appreciate being spied on. But alas, this gig wasn’t all it was supposed to be.\n			As the ship rounded the dust cloud the hazy shape morphed and warped, every angle giving new shape to the collection of rocks. It was quite beautiful, like one of those 3D sculptures that wiggles and jiggles with the wind or to the tune of sensors, controlled by a computer and bent into shape by pulleys and servos. It was a feat of engineering, but nowhere near as impressive—or quiet—as a dust ball floating in space. Now there was some real beauty.\n			A soft bleep sounded in James’ ear, indicating an incoming transmission. He reached up a lazy hand and tapped on his earlobe, allowing the call through.\n			“What is it?” he muttered.\n			“So— Sorry to disturb you,” said a quiet man, a nervous quiver in his voice. “We’ve found some really weird… er… stuff?”\n			Sidler sighed. Wayne, the new guy on this voyage, still found it hard to string a sentence together in the presence of the higher-ranking officers on board. While the journey out here had taken a little more than a year, he’d only been <em>awake</em> on the ship for a day, tops. Which meant he was still very much green.\n			“Weird how?” Sidler asked.\n			“Weird like… like a… space… termite mound!” Wayne said. The simile was pronounced with confidence at having come up with a description that might make some sense.\n			Sidler sighed, again. “Just tell me what it is, man. Spit it out, would you?” His voice was kind but firm. It was only the kid’s second day, after all.\n			“Oh. Yes sir.”\n			The word grated on James, sending a shiver up his spine and making him wince. He was in the army once, but that was a long time ago. “Sidler will do, if you please.”\n			“Oh. Right. Sorry…”\n			A pause hung in the air, a quiet static floating over the otherwise silent transmission.\n			“Have you forgotten what it was you were talking about, boy?”\n			“No! No, sir— Er, Sidler!” Wayne spluttered. “Excuse me. It’s… about the cloud.”\n			“Okay,” Sidler muttered, patiently.\n			“Yeah. Well it seems to be alive?”\n			<em>Alive?</em> Sidler thought. “Alive how?”\n			“We’re… not entirely sure,” Wayne said. “There seems to be a small electromagnetic field around the whole formation. And the chunks kind of… jiggle from time to time. And they seem to be shrinking.”\n			Shrinking? He couldn’t see anything from here. The captain made a gesture to bring up a zoomed-in display window on the surface of the glass. It didn’t show much, with the ship moving at a constant rate; it was all a little blurry with the cameras shifting position from moment to moment.\n			“You see,” Wayne continued, “we think there must be some molecular reaction eating up the matter and releasing electrostatic energy.”\n			“Not if they’re just space rocks they aren’t,” Sidler breathed.\n			“Well, we were thinking it could be some new element not on the Periodic—”\n			“Nah. If it was that, then why would it still be here a year after we saw it from Earth? Wouldn’t it have eaten itself up by now?” He paused for a moment, thinking. “Send down the stills, would you?”.\n			“Oh. Right, sir…”\n			Sidler heard the snap of a salute on the other end of the connection and let a wry smile come to his face. Was <em>he</em> ever that fresh-faced?\n			He gazed out at the collection of rocks hanging silently in the dark. The spotlights of the ship could only illuminate small patches of the anomaly, the white circles of light sliding over the thousands of tiny formations. If the chunks really were shrinking, they could disappear within an hour of them arriving, and then they’d have nothing to go on. They had to figure this thing out, and fast, if they were to get anything out of this.\n			“And send out a probe while you’re at it, would you?” Sidler said. “We need a closer look at this.”\n			“On it, sir,” Wayne replied.\n			A new window opened on the glass of the observation deck, and still images began resolving as they loaded. James glanced at the first and it enlarged automatically, giving him a better idea of what he was looking at. Rocks. He examined the images one by one: more rocks, yet more rocks, and—oh look—a slightly larger rock. How wonderful.\n			“Have we got anything closer?”\n			“Not yet, sir. The second pass should give us more of an idea—”\n			“Well start the second pass now, then.” Sidler said. “It could all be gone by the time we finish our first orbit.”\n			“Oh. Of course, sir.” Wayne said. “I’m on it.”\n			The captain rubbed his face. <em>No peace for the wicked, huh?</em> he thought.\n			He made another gesture, swapping out the window to show him the realtime view from the probe. It slowly made its way to the cloud, its mechanical arms hanging in front of the camera, waiting to poke and pry. A timecode readout showed in the top-right corner: “i-53”; 53 seconds to intercept. He had time to kill.\n			Sidler took another sip of his tea. He leaned back and watched the phenomena, letting the realtime feed shrink and move to one side. The rocks continued their slow, amorphous shift as the ship slowly orbited around them. It was lit softly by the Explorer’s floodlights, being half a kilometer away. Now and then something in the rocks sparkled, light reflected by some substance clinging to the face of the rocks. It was quite beautiful, how it shone and winked. It reminded him of staring up at the trees back home, squinting at the light as it dappled through the autumn leaves.\n			Bringing up a new window with a flick of the wrist, Sidler brought up the stats they had found so far. From the gravitational readings and weight calculations, the rock formations were almost 100% pure carbon. But then why was it glinting in the light?\n			Most naturally-forming carbon rocks were dull grey, or even black. But these chunks glistened, almost as though there were diamond veins embedded into the rocks themselves, some shining through to the surface. But that kind of atomic structure needed thousands of years under high pressure. It was simply impossible for such a material to form in space. Maybe the readouts were incorrect. He’d have to schedule a recalibration when they got back home.\n			He glanced back at the view outside the window. The shape of the cloud seemed to coalesce now, slowly forming a more definite shape. It only looked like a couple of blobs, side by side, but it felt purposeful, as if the massive collection of dust and rocks had been shaped with an ice-cream scoop.\n			Bringing a hand up to his ear, his stroked its edge, hailing the crew in the main diagnostics area.\n			“Gregson reporting, sir,” came a gruff voice.\n			Another shudder. Gregson had served under him for 3 tours now; with tens of thousands of logged hours on the Explorer. The man knew Sidler’s name, but still stubbornly refused to go off-book for anyone.\n			“Sidler here,” the captain said, grudgingly. “I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind turning off those lights for a moment?”\n			“The lights? But why—”\n			“Just humour me, would you?”\n			“Well, I…”\n			Sidler sighed. They’d danced this dance so many times over the years. They both knew how it would end.\n			“That’s an order?”\n			“Yes, sir!” Gregson called enthusiastically, his voice clipping over the tiny speaker in the captain’s ear.\n			After a moment’s pause the lights switched off, the bulbs dimming as their meter-long elements cooled in the cold of space. He could see something now, a design etched in the cloud’s form, it’s face lit by the nearby sun, its hollowed-out innards hidden in shadow.\n			“Thanks, Gregson.” Sidler swiped at his ear once more, switching channels back to analytics. “Are you seeing this up there, Wayne?” he asked.\n			“Yeah…” the boy replied in hushed tones. “What is it?”\n			There were two distinct circles on the left and right, with a single line joining them. A single, smaller dot was also lit up in the middle of each circle. At the bottom edge of the left-hand circle, a line was drawn down, away from the circumference, and a similar line was drawn at the top of the circle to the right. The symbol was clear and brazen. This kind of clear design didn’t occur naturally, especially not in space.\n			“You’re recording this, right?” Sidler asked.\n			“Sure am, sir,” Wayne replied.\n			The captain tapped a finger on the arm of his chair. “This isn’t some kind of joke, is it? A hoax or something?”\n			The boy gave a nervous laugh. “Has to be… doesn’t it? There’s no way— Extraterrestrial life—”\n			“We’ve finally found it,” Sidler said, his voice hushed. “Evidence we’re not alone in the universe.”\n			Mankind had searched for centuries, looking for hard evidence that there was something out there. Had they really found them? Some fellow sentients to play with?\n			“Can you lift the design and re-render?” the captain said.\n			“Sure can…” Sidler heard the clicks and clacks of a keyboard in the background. “I’ve got it.” The design appeared on the window in front of the captain.\n			“Okay, now search our databases for anything similar,” Sidler said. “I know I’ve seen that symbol somewhere before…”\n			“On it.”\n			James took another sip of tea, still warm, thanks to the non-thermally-conductive material the mug was made of. There was something bothering him about the way the cloud sparkled here and there. What did it mean? He glanced back at the probe’s view once again. “I minus 21,” he mouthed. He was close enough to the chunks to have a better look now, and made a gesture to zoom in to the microscopic level, turning on the high-contrast setting.\n			There seemed to be bugs crawling about the surface of the rock, thousands of them crawling across the view. As the probe drew closer, more and more detail showed itself on-screen. Their backs had tiny ridges on them that seemed to flutter every few seconds, rippling the sea of microscopic creatures. Though they walked over each other constantly as one writhing mass, they seemed to move with purpose. There was a pattern to it.\n			A bleep sounded, and James tapped his ear. “Okay, I found something,” Wayne said. “But I’m not sure what it means…”\n			“Just send it over. I’ll take a look,” Sidler said, drawing another mouthful of tea and swishing it around.\n			A new window popped up in the centre of the window. It showed an encyclopedia entry, along with a single, large image. It showed a copper rectangle with all manner of diagrams, including a statuesque image of a man and woman standing naked to one side. What was this?\n			He glanced up at the title of the article: “Pioneer plaque.” He looked at the image again, and now noticed the two circles joined by a line. Back in the 70s, a couple of scientists came up with a way of introducing the human species to any extraterrestrial intelligence that may find the message. It included a diagram of hydrogen—that same symbol carved into the dust cloud—as well as a map of the solar system and some telemetry showing where it was in relation to the galaxy. It all looked like gobbledygook to James, but someone thought it was a good idea at the time. Could the anomaly be an homage to that message, sent all that time ago with the two Pioneer spacecraft?\n			He looked more closely at the hydrogen symbol, looking back and forth between the one lifted from the cloud. There were some minor differences in the original earth version. The lines poking out of the circles were arrows, both at the top of their respective circles, and the dots in each circle were also arrows, both pointing up. The science was beyond him, but the similarity was too much of a coincidence. Just as mankind had attempted to communicate through use of the mathematics of the hydrogen atom, so did this other, alien species.\n			This was monumental. This could change everything…\n			Sidler felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. But the sign—the monument they’d searched so many years to find—was shrinking, being eaten up by those microscopic creatures. He looked back at the probe’s view. Now attached to the rock, it was close enough to get a much better picture of whatever life form was crawling around on the rocks’ surfaces. He switched to an electromagnetic view of the rock.\n			“Woah…” he cooed. “Hey kid? I think we’ve got a problem.”\n			“What’s that?” Wayne said. “Did I do something wrong?”\n			“No, no. Just… hurry up with your analysis, okay?”\n			“Right… But may I ask why, sir?”\n			The captain took a deep breath. “Take a look at the probe’s EM view.”\n			“Okay.”\n			“Now zoom in to micro-level.”\n			“Right. Oh damn…” Wayne said. “What <em>are</em> they?”\n			“Machines? Nanites?” Sidler said. “They could be organic, but they’re giving off too much EM for that. Besides, you see that shimmer? Those things are made of metal.”\n			“I concur,” Wayne said. “It almost seems like they’re chewing up the carbon, then wriggling to the surface to simply eject it. But why—”\n			“To hide the evidence.”\n			“Sir?”\n			“Clearly, the sign was meant to be found, just as ours was hundreds of years ago,” the captain explained. “We probably would have found other signs sooner—maybe the fibonacci sequence or prime numbers—but, for whatever reason, whoever made these monuments to intelligent life changed their minds. And now, everything they laid out for us to see is being ground to dust.”\n			“Which is why we never found them. They didn’t <em>want</em> to be found. But why would they change their minds like that?”\n			“Who knows?” Sidler said with a shrug. “Maybe—”\n			“Sir. The carbon chunks. They’re shrinking.”\n			“They’re being eaten by nanites; they’ve been shrinking for the past hour.”\n			“No, sir. It’s nearly all—”\n			The captain stared out at the cloud, so thin and weak it was now just a glimmer of light against the blackness of space. And then, like sugar in coffee, it silently vanished. He glanced over at the probe feed. There was nothing there now, though there seemed to be shadows shifting and moving across the video. It was as if there was interference in the connection. But with the proximity, and with line of sight—\n			“Oh no,” Sidler breathed.\n			“What is it, captain?”\n			The captain zoomed the picture all the way out to reveal more tiny machines still squirming and quivering as they had done before. “The nanites,” Sidler said. “They’ve migrated to the probe.” The feed flickered, and went dead. They made short work of that.\n			“Great,” Wayne said. “There goes our insurance bonus.”\n			But it wasn’t just that. If they could move themselves through space—and clearly they <em>could</em>, if they’d reached the probe—they’d latch on to the hull of the ship. This space bucket was stacked with sensors, but the only defensive features was a thick hull that could withstand small meteor showers, nothing that could hope to fend off these near-invisible, microscopic machines. They’d never make it back before the Explorer, and everything inside, was ground to dust by the tiny machines. And even if they could somehow reach Earth or one of its colonies before the hull was turned to dust, the nanites would spread, chewing up any matter they could find until there was nothing left. These machines may have started out as a tool used to hide evidence there was life out there… but now they were a trap, a disease that destroyed anything it touched.\n			“Package the data and send it off as soon as you can,” the captain said urgently.\n			“But—”\n			“That’s an order, rookie!” He sounded like his drill sergeant. But there was no time to mess about.\n			He would never again see his empty flat. He would never again feel the ice cap melting heat of the sun on his face. He would never again see the beautiful blue gem of the Earth peering through a layer of polluted atmosphere.\n			Sidler tapped his other earlobe, cutting off his connection with the new guy and establishing a new one. “This is the captain speaking.” He could hear his voice echoing down the corridor outside the observation deck. He closed his eyes and swallowed hard. He couldn’t run. He couldn’t fight. The ship would go down with all hands. All he could do for his crew now was give them a quiet send-off. “All hands, prepare for stasis in one hour.”\n		")

		prose("Part 1", "\n			“So… hoax or natural phenomenon?”\n			Sergeant Francis Simons glanced at his neighbour, a quick steely glare with no care to hide his contempt. Mr. Cadwell, a civvy no less, had been asking everyone on this trip their opinion on the matter; useless banter which, even if the answer had some importance beyond affecting mission parameters, only served to annoy the sergeant. After a quick flash of warning, Simons looked back down at his brief and continued reading.\n			“Come on, sarge! Make a bet to keep the troops happy!” Cadwell said jovially, nudging his mark and shoving the few dollar bills he had collected thus far in the man’s face. His voice was loud over the mic, clipping a little and making Simons wince as it bellowed through the sound-guard speakers over his ears.\n			“I wouldn’t nudge him too vigorously, Cadwell,” another man said. “You wouldn’t want his weapon to discharge in your direction, would you?” Simons glanced up at the man, still unsure of his motives in all of this, before returning to his papers.\n			The scientist sat with one leg crossed casually over the other facing the other two across the aisle of the helicopter cabin. His hair was slicked back and his pointy nose was stuck into a newspaper he held lightly between his long, almost dainty fingers. While Cadwell put on a good show, Simons could tell the man was on edge; the whole betting deal just his way of coping with a new situation. But the scientist, one Dr. Presse, seemed utterly nonplussed by events, reading carelessly through the centre pages of the Financial Times and even, at times, bobbing his right leg up and down as it hung limply across his left knee. Did the man have no discipline at all?\n			“Okay boys, ETA 1 minute,” the pilot’s voice announced over the headphones. “And ah… If you’re interested, there’s a nice view of the place off to starboard.”\n			With that, Simons looked out the right-side of the cabin, Cadwell craning his neck to see out the left. With a sigh, Simons grabbed the man by the chin and turned it to face the right way.\n			Just on the horizon, where the ivory desert met the deep blue sky, a few notches of white seemed to jut out of the landscape. As the helicopter sped towards the anomaly, two—no, three—white shapes now seemed to hang in the air just above the surface of the dunes. Below them, a small clearing had formed, the sands swept aside revealing the bedrock below, short cliffs now protruding into the light, likely the first time in millennia.\n			“What are they? Hot air balloons?” Cadwell muttered. He turned to look at the other two. “Not much of a UFO, is it?”\n			“No one said they were,” Presse said smoothly, still gazing out the window at the objects.\n			“Why are we not approaching direct?” Simons asked, looking over at the pilot. They weren’t some tourists on a Grand Canyon fly-by.\n			“Easier to see out the side, don’t you think?” Cadwell said.\n			“We are here to see the objects, after all; and what better way to see them than from the air?” Presse said. Cadwell tried to hide the shock of the professor agreeing with a mere mortal such as himself, but failed badly. Presse shot Cadwell another look of disdain. “Well we are, aren’t we?” he said, with a shrug.\n			“The airspace around the site isn’t fly-safe at the moment, sergeant.” came the pilot’s voice over the ear-guards. “That’s how we first found the place… at the expense of a pilot, his navigator, and $200,000 worth of chopper.” He paused for a second, before continuing, “It ain’t pretty down there, so the civvies may want to brace themselves. ETA 1 minute.”\n			The pilot clicked off and the three sat quiet in contemplation, staring awkwardly out the window and at each other. A man was dead and they were just sight-seeing? What would they see when they got there? Twisted rotor blades... a mangled body?\n			A minute passed quickly and as the helicopter descended the dust and sand kicked up in a whirlpool of chaos, assaulting the windows and grinding against the bodywork. “Is this hunk of junk gonna survive the landing?” Cadwell shouted, his knuckles white on the hand loops bolted to the cabin walls.\n			Simons shrugged. “You’ll just have to hope and pray, I guess.”\n			Presse smirked and looked over at the civilian.\n			With one last shudder, the chopper was grounded and the rotors started spinning down, the high-pitched whirring the three had gotten used to changing and warping, seeming to get louder the deeper the noise went. Simons saw the pilot unbuckle and exit the cockpit over the doctor’s shoulder, and proceeded to unclip his harness in kind. Presse began to do the same, but Cadwell still stared wide-eyed out the starboard side.\n			Suddenly, the door opened with a <em>cha-chunk</em> and slid across the length of the body towards the rear, odd particles of sand and dust swooshing into the cabin. The pilot had his head ducked, the heavy helmet and big goggles dwarfing his head. “Ride ends here, folks,” he said with a smile. “Welcome to Area 51.”\n			Cadwell gasped. “Area fifty—” He stopped and glanced at the other two passengers, a wry smile on each of their faces. “Oh, ha ha. Very funny,” Cadwell said dryly, stepping out of the cabin.\n			“Sorry about my little joke, Mr. Cadwell. Air Force humour, you understand…” the pilot said over his shoulder as he turned and walked across the landing pad.\n			As the three followed him, Simons could now see the temporary pad had been set up only a few days ago; the ground was hard beneath his feet, the dark grey jigsaw pieces of the pad only barely visible underneath the thick layer of sand that had accrued since the pad’s assembly, leaving it completely invisible from the air. The Air Force did like to keep their operations below the radar, and beyond the attention of the regular satellites at least.\n			“So. What are we here for, anyway?” Cadwell asked as they climbed up a nearby sand dune.\n			The pilot gave a light laugh and stopped at the edge of the pad. “No idea, sir. I just work here. The site is just over the dune there,” he said, pointing up a nearby mound of sand.\n			Presse pushed on up the dune. “I would guess we’re here to Investigate those things,” he said, raising a hand to point at the shapes now peeking above the top of the dune.\n			Simons looked up to follow the man’s gesture. Two white triangles protruded into the blue sky, still hazy with the odd gust of wind scattering motes of sand across the dune’s surface.\n			Cadwell reached the top first. “Wow. I… wasn’t expecting that.”\n			Presse joined him and they both stood gawking at the objects. “So there’s a couple of pyramids…” Simons muttered to himself. “What’s the big—” As he crested the sand, the words failed him and his jaw grew slack.\n			Two giant white cubes, at least a football field along one edge hung in the air above the site, a third hovering in the centre of the cliffs below. “What the hell are those?”\n			Presse shrugged. “My guess would be cubes. Perfectly symmetrical, six-sided three-dimensional squares.”\n			“But they’re flying!” Cadwell spluttered.\n			“Correction: they’re hovering,” Presse said. “Perfectly stationary without any tether or connection to the ground. A feat in itself. But that’s not all. See how perfect the lines are? How the shade and light is constant across each surface?”\n			“So what?” Cadwell chirped. “You can get flat-screen TVs just like it.”\n			“But a single, unbroken surface of that size? No refractions or speculars? No bowing at the corners or centre? Such perfection cannot be made. It is an impossibility. They’ve been out here for—what?—a week or so? And not a scratch on it from the sands… What we are looking at, gentlemen, is physically impossible.”\n			“You can tell all that from way down here?” Simons asked. “What makes you so sure it’s as perfect as you say it is?”\n			Presse shrugged. “I don’t say it is,” he said, and started walking, in silence.\n			The sergeant gave a dry laugh and followed the doctor, leaving Cadwell still staring into space. Another minute and he’d be fuming.\n			As they walked down the other side of the dune, the sand slipped and slid from beneath their feet off towards the cliffs and the site below. Simons could see the rough edges of the rocks, now. It was odd how some surfaces had been brushed smooth by the sands and others had stayed rugged and solid. “Mind the rough edges of the rocks,” the sergeant called. “They’ve been buried in the sand for thousands of years, so there’s no telling what nasty viruses and diseases a cut would give you.”\n			“It’s a wonder they didn’t give us gloves to navigate around the site with,” Presse said ahead of Simons. “No doubt they’ll have some secure protocol for investigating the objects.”\n			“Investigating—” Cadwell muttered behind them. “But you don’t think <em>I’m</em>—”\n			Presse looked back over his shoulder. “Yes… it is a little hard to grasp why the army—”\n			“<em>Air Force</em>,” Simons corrected.\n			“—would want a plebeian such as yourself along for the ride.” He looked back down into the site, waving his arms about for balance as he picked his way across the dunes. “Simons here will do for a security chaperone, I’ll bring the academic insight… but I can’t imagine what<em>you’ll</em> bring to the table on this venture.”\n			“Oh, that’s a bit harsh,” Simons said. Cadwell murmured in agreement behind them. “I’m sure he makes a great cup of coffee…”\n			“Now look here—” Cadwell said, raising his voice and clenching his fists.\n			At that moment, a man stepped forward from… where? There were no examination tents, rocky outcrops or structures of any kind. And yet there he was, appearing as if out of nothing and standing in the middle of the clearing.\n			“Welcome to the site, my friends,” the man said, jovially. “Welcome one and all!” He had an air of Willy Wonka, or the guy out of Jurassic Park. He stood at barely 5’ 10”, a nicely sized belly and a smile on his face. His eyes gleamed in wonder, almost staring through the trio as they walked across the smooth, rocky terrain towards him.\n			“Sergeant Simons,” Simons announced, then gestured to his companions. “This is Doctor Presse, and Mr. Cadwell.\n			“Yes, of course. Doctor Presse!” The man reached out a hand, and the doctor took it. The shorter man shuffled slowly backwards as he expounded enthusiastically. “So glad to meet you sir! Your work on dimensional mathematics remains on my desk at all times. A wondrous insight. Truly marvelous!\n			“And Simons,” he continued, letting go of Presse and looking at the sergeant. “I do hope we haven’t inconvenienced you by asking you out here on such short notice…”\n			Simons stiffened. “I do as I’m ordered, sir,” he said, following a step or two behind the other two gentlemen. “It is one’s duty to carry out orders, after all.”\n			“Ah…” the man cooed. “True, true. And… Cadwell. Where is Cadwell?” He seemed a little anxious, now, peering around the other two to find the third man. Simons and Presse stopped and turned to see him dawdling a good hundred yards or so away, staring up at the cubes hanging in mid-air.\n			“Cadwell!” Simons barked. “Stand to attention, would you?” The civilian looked down, now, hand to his forehead shielding his vision from the sun. “Come here, man!”\n			“But… where are you?” Cadwell called. He seemed to squint in their direction, still searching for the party.\n			“Look, Cadwell,” Simons said firmly, starting back towards the other man. “This isn’t the time for larking about. Now I—”\n			“Woah!” Cadwell cried, taking a step back and almost tripping over a rogue stone. There was a look of utter awe on his face now, staring at Simons in disbelief.\n			The sergeant sighed and glanced back at the two waiting behind him. Only they were gone, now. But they were only a dozen steps back; how could he not see them? Simons took a step back towards the pair, and suddenly they were back again. A muffled cry came from Cadwell’s direction. Had he disappeared, as the others had done?\n			There was a quiet noise resounding from the man who greeted them, his shoulders bobbing and girth bouncing with his quiet chuckle. “Oh, I am sorry, sergeant. When one has seen what I have seen one must have his little jokes…”\n			Presse looked at the man to his side, and then back out at Simons, and finally at Cadwell. He squinted for a moment, seemed to be focussing on something. Then a look of understanding came over his face. The portly man looked at the doctor and gleamed ever more brightly, though Simons would not have believed it to be possible.\n			“So this is—” Presse began.\n			The short man yelped in glee.\n			“And that means—”\n			“Mhmm…” the man said, giggling to himself.\n			“Cool…” Presse sighed, eyes wide.\n			“Er… guys?” Cadwell called. “Are you gonna come out now or what?”\n			Simons looked back at the civvy, still stood way back from the rest of them.\n			“Sergeant,” the man asked gently. “If you would be so kind as to guide Mr. Cadwell over to us?”\n			Simons nodded curtly and strode off towards the last man.\n			“Oh. Hey,” Cadwell called, as Simons started towards him. “So what—”\n			“I dunno,” the sergeant replied, taking him by the hand and starting back towards the others.\n			“But you totally—”\n			“I know.”\n			The doctor and their welcomer popped into view as they entered the shadow of the giant floating cube. It was only now Simons noticed the change in temperature as they entered the shadow. It wasn’t just the shade from the desert sun, but there seemed to be something in the air underneath the shape; an electricity to the air that set Simons’ teeth on edge.\n			“Ah, Mr. Cadwell!” the portly gentleman exclaimed. “Thank you so much for joining us!” He shook Cadwell’s hand wildly with a big grin across his face.\n			When Cadwell finally managed to pull his hand away from the enthusiastic shake, he didn’t look too happy. “Look, man. This is not cool. One minute I’m minding my own business, walking along the street, when a black van pulls up and five guys in suits pop out…”\n			Simons and Presse looked at each other and then at the civilian.\n			“I know, right? They grab me, mumble something about National Security, shove me in the back of their kidnapp-mobile and drive off. I had groceries! They need to be refrigerated!”\n			There was a pregnant pause in the air. Simons shifted uncomfortably at the decidedly anti-climactic end to Cadwell’s story. Presse broke the silence. “Well, while I do not share Mr. Cadwell’s concern for perishables, I too would like to know what’s going on here. Sure, there are enormous hexahedrons floating around in the Sahara, but I’m not sure what that has to do with us.”\n			“I agree… sir,” Simons chimed in. “If there is work to be done, I’m happy to serve, but I would appreciate a brief of the situation to assess potential risks. Is there a facility installed here where we can receive orders? Are you the commanding officer?”\n			The man raised his hands to calm the three. “Yes, yes, I am sorry about all of that…” he said, starting to walk back and forth in worried thought. “Time is of the essence, and needs must… but introductions are in order.”\n			He stopped mid-stride and turned to the face them all. “My name is… well you may<em>call</em> me… Faust. Yes, that will do. Faust.”\n			Simons glanced at the other two. A pseudonym? They come all this way and all they get is a blasted codename?\n			“My name is Simons, and this is Presse and Cadwell,” he said, gesturing to the other two. He took in a breath and held it for a moment, deciding on what he should say and how to say it. “I’m sorry sir, but… is anonymity really necessary? I assure you I do have a level E clearance and, well… clearly you trust us if you brought us all to see these desert cubes.”\n			Faust gave a quiet chuckle at this, though his face looked pained. “Yes. Yes, you’re right,” he said. “And I am sorry I cannot divulge my identity at present. But all in due time. All in due…” Faust raised his left arm and pulled the sleeve of his white coat back to reveal a watch.\n			Simons couldn’t see the time from here, but judging by the shadows, it must have been near noon. There was something off about the watch, however. Though there was no direct sunlight shining on the device, it seemed to be very bright; a light blue light dazzling and glistening, lighting up the man’s white coat. As Simons stared at it his vision started to blur. There was no pain, but he closed his eyes and shook his head anyway. When he opened his eyes he could see perfectly fine. Was he suffering from heatstroke or something?\n			“Well!” Faust exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “Your journey begins here,” he said, turning and gesturing towards the space under the cube. “Shall we begin?”\n			“Er… yes?” Cadwell said.\n			Simons and Presse didn’t move an inch. The sergeant was a good soldier, and followed orders, but this Faust did not wear any insignia that let Simons to believe he was a superior officer. Or even an officer at all.\n			The portly man looked dejected, face dropping and eyes looking sad. “I see you do not trust me as yet.”\n			“Or the giant cubes,” Presse said. “We mathematicians talk big, but we really have no idea how dimensions work beyond the 3 already defined. We could be turned inside out if we go too far into the field!”\n			“Wait— Inside out? Dimensions?” Cadwell said, confused. “Just what are we talking about here?”\n			Faust looked angry now, raising his voice in something other than pure joy for the first time since he appeared. “<em>I</em> trust the cubes, and I have been on this journey for longer than—” He stopped himself and straightened. “I’m sorry. You are new here, and you have a right to be wary of them. But we do have a deadline. We must move quickly else… else we may not be able to change it. This is my last trip…” He brought up a hand, fingers rubbing together in anticipation. “And it must count!” His hand became a fist, clenched tight and white at the knuckles. Whatever he was talking about, he was serious.\n			The man turned, looking intently into the gap between the cube and the desert floor. He walked, slowly at first, but soon striding with purpose, until finally, he vanished.\n		")

		prose("\n			Jamie sat on the wooden bench on the edge of the quad, watching the last few stragglers cut through the grass to the main gate in the opposite corner. Two students lurched a ball between them, one telekinetically pushing it back to the other as it fell towards them in the air, the other lurching it back. They seemed so happy—to be here, to hone their abilities… Jamie didn’t have any of that.\n			He often wondered why the school chose him in the first place. He clearly had no talent with the gift. He barely qualified as a Telkin at all. How could he be expected to keep up with the class when he couldn’t so much as bend a frickin’ spoon?\n			He looked back down at the papers in front of him. To the left, a textbook showed graphs and diagrams of how “lurching” applies force to an object from a Telkin’s centre of mass. To the right, sheets of homework asked questions about the ethics of using telekinesis on animate objects. While he found the ethics lessons interesting, he couldn’t deny the futility of it all. With his grades, he’d never make it past this semester, let alone graduation. Unless he could fix it.\n			Jamie heard footsteps coming down the concrete path, off to his left. He leaned over his books, hiding his face and trying to look busy. The man walked past and off to the right, paying no attention to the student. <em>Just like in class,</em> Jamie thought. He glanced at the teacher as he turned the corner into the entranceway of the faculty block. Mr. Simmons was off to his office, as expected, and right on time.\n			Jamie started packing his papers into his backpack, looking around at the quad, alert for any more students hanging around. Happy he was clear, he stood and began shuffling towards the building entrance, careful not to catch up to Simmons.\n			The penalty for getting kicked out of Telekinetic School for the Gifted or failing to graduate was made clear to every student attending. There was even a law: any Telkin that cannot demonstrate control and competency with their power is banned from using it. Of course, what was not explicitly stated in that law was that the “banned” part meant getting neutered. The poor sod would be dragged away and have the part of the brain responsible for their power surgically removed.\n			Jamie knew how poorly he was doing in the classes, none so poorly as in Simmons’ torque class, dedicated to developing raw telekinetic strength. He’d already been held back to repeat a semester, and if he didn’t pass this time he’d be expelled for sure. He’d be deemed a danger to society. He’d be neutered. But if everything went according to plan, it wouldn’t get that far.\n			He entered the faculty building and started towards Simmons’ office. He was familiar with the building; its rich chestnut panelling, its fraying silk carpets running down the centre of the hallways, its almost sweet musty smell. The smell of defeat, of failure. He’d seen these halls all too often, called for extra lessons and for stern talks about responsibility or “put some damn effort into it, Jamie”.\n			He counted off two doors, and slowed as he approached the third. A gold plaque on the door told him he’d found the right one, announcing “Mr. Edward Simmons, Torque Teacher”.\n			Jamie felt his heart thump loud in his ears. Was he really going to do this? Once he took this step, there would be no going back. But what else could he do? Swinging his backpack around to the side, he leant back against the smooth wooden wall and sunk to the floor. He had to get comfortable if this was going to work. Silently, he took in a deep breath, closed his eyes, and relaxed.\n			He let the universe speak to him, felt for the presence of the people nearby. Slowly, he became aware of the teachers in their offices, some with students sitting across from them taking notes or silently letting the lectures wash over them. And there, just behind him, sat Mr. Simmons. He drew closer to the teacher, brushing by him ever so gently so as to not spook him. Jamie drew in a new breath, held it, and reached out.\n			The dark world suddenly burst with light and colour. He found himself looking down at some ledger or other, pen in hand, stopped mid-sentence in an illegible, cramped script. He was in.\n			He stood, Simmons’ larger girth wobbling slightly, threatening to unbalance him. Jamie held on, forcefully commanding the teacher’s body to stand firm. It obeyed. He may suck at lurch-ball, but this was his forte. No one in his class could do <em>this</em>. Maybe no one in the <em>world</em> could do this.\n			He walked around the large desk, sidling past the square edges and stepping up to the filing cabinet in the opposite corner. Shoving his large, pudgy hands into his pockets, he rifled around, searching for the key. Finally, his fingers brushed against something hard and metallic. Pulling the key out of his pocket, he slid it easily into the filing cabinet lock and turned.\n			Jamie stepped back, pulling out the top draw before stretching out his arms and cracking his knuckles, a grin on his face. Simmons would be horrified if he knew. He flicked through the hundreds of files, scanning each name as he went. The cabinet would be full to bursting with files on each student. With such a small percentage of the population having the ability, there were few teachers who had the gift and who knew it well enough themselves to teach others how to use and control the power. Which meant each teacher had to teach every kid in the school, week-in, week-out.\n			Baern, Braithwaite… “Brath, James,” he said, Simmons’ older voice crackling in place of his own. He carefully removed the file from the cabinet, laying it flat on top of the others. He hesitated. He didn’t care about grades, graduation, or even getting expelled. Was it too much to ask for everyone to leave him alone? To keep his brain in one piece? Still, forcing a teacher to change his grade without him even knowing… Steeling himself, Jamie reached forward, watching as the teacher’s hairy hand start to slowly open the file.\n			A sudden tap on the shoulder snapped him back to the corridor outside. He recoiled from the figure standing over him\n			“Now, that’s quite enough of that, son,” the man said, with a warm smile.\n			“I don’t—” Jamie said. “I wasn’t— I just dozed off, sir.”\n			The man let out a low chuckle. “You can’t fool me, son. So best not try, eh?”\n			“What— But I—” Jamie started to push himself up off of the floor, feeling foolish. How did he ever think this would go smoothly? Did anything <em>ever</em> go as planned?\n			“What’s your name, son?”\n			“Jamie,” the boy said, looking away. “Brath. Sir.”\n			“Very well, Brath.” The man looked up and down the corridor, conspiratorially. Who was this guy? Jamie didn’t recognise him as one of the regular teachers. “I tell you what. You don’t try anything so foolhardy as this again, and I’ll help you out.”\n			“But I didn’t—”\n			“You aren’t the only one in the world that can do what you do, okay?” the man continued. “There are more of us than you realise—than the world realises. But it’s not as simple as it looks, son.” He paused. “Listen, you can take it or leave it, but if you attend some extra lessons with me after school, I can teach you how to use your gifts. Plus, I’ll keep your head above water with Simmons. The <em>right</em> way.” He stuck out a hand and waited for Jamie to take it. “Deal?”\n			Jamie eyed the hand. Did this man really know what Jamie was doing? Were there really others like him? Of course, the alternative would be expulsion and neutering. Uncertain, he took the hand and shook it weakly.\n			“Who are you, anyway?” he asked, glancing back up at the man.\n			“Bartholomew Dorn.” Jamie gave a blank look. “Careers advisor?”\n			Jamie snorted a laugh despite himself.

Not much of a choice.\n			“I know, right?” Dorn said with a cheeky grin. “Lots of nothing to do, but the pay’s good. It’s a ‘those that can’t do teach’ kind of a thing. Although I guess it’s more like ‘those who can’t teach, advise’… but whatever. See you tomorrow, then.” He started walk backwards down the corridor. “After class. Don’t forget, now!” Finally, he turned and disappeared around a corner, leaving Jamie alone.\n			He felt the eerie silence of the building settle back in around him, the musty smell resuming its hold. <em>More extra lessons,</em> he thought.<em> Great.</em>\n		")

		prose("\n			Technical Archaeologist Shawn Priors picked his way through the dark tunnel. The walls of rock around him were smooth, butter carved by a hot knife. He was always amazed at the precision of the Molecular Reorganisers—known informally as MRs, or Emers—to produce these perfectly formed tunnels in solid rock. The hulking Pathfinder vehicles up ahead had carved the passage mere hours earlier, Emers mounted to the face of their snub-nosed cabins. They’d been working their way through the mountain for the better part of a day until they found the anomaly. Which was where Priors came in.\n			The cavity, a rectangular box with a high ceiling, lay not too far off the centre of the mountain. The Pathfinder pilot was surprised to see such a large space hidden within the rock, but Priors wasn’t. He had sent a few Pathfinders off burrowing into the mountain at different angles of attack, hedging his bets in case the map wasn’t as accurate as he suspected. But he knew this would be the one to find what he was looking for.\n			So here he was, important work to be done. He would keep the development low-key for the moment. If the commander of the army escort he’d been given got too interested it could become awkward later down the line. The TechArchs had a very particular brand of secrecy; a way of making ground-breaking discoveries in plain sight, then keeping it quiet until they deemed it <em>absolutely necessary</em> their military cohorts be informed of their technological advances. Tell them what you’re after, and they’d dismiss it out of hand. Let them know from what you <em>found</em> and you’d have phone calls twice a day asking if the TechArch investigation was ready to give them their “tactical advantage” yet.\n			In theory, the TechArch ministry was neutral. Any discovery they made would become available to all of mankind; such was the remit of order. Whatever organisation helped them uncover a discovery would simply get the revelation a little earlier than the rest of the known universe.\n			Reaching the end of the tunnel, he could make out a sliver of cool light streaming in to one side of the silhouette of hulking metal, blocking the entrance to the tunnel.\n			Priors tapped on the side of the Pathfinder. “Can we get this thing moving?” he called, his voice recorded and simultaneously blasted out of a speaker in the side of his headgear. “I’ve got delicate instruments, here!”\n			“Oh. Yeah…” the mumbled response came from the other side. “One moment, TechArch.” Electric motors spun up, a high-pitched whine reverberating around the chamber and back down the tunnel. Then the machine lurched forward, cab bouncing lightly off of the tunnel’s ceiling as the pneumatic suspension bobbed in response. The vehicle rolled forward until it left a man-sized gap between it at the hole in the rock, and Priors squeezed through, careful not to catch the sensors and antennae on the rocks.\n			The man on the other side stood at attention. “That’ll do, thank you sergeant,” Priors called to him, walking calmly past. Such military favours were not part of TechArch etiquette, though it was always amusing to see the peons trying to figure out if they should salute the man they were to take orders from, despite his being a simple civilian. As long as they did as told, Priors was fine with a little awkward posturing from time to time.\n			It seemed the Pathfinder had tunneled to one corner of the chamber, and now obscured all but the wall to one side. Only as he rounded the end of the machine did it become clear to him that this was no simple cavity in the rock. He gazed in awe at the towering dark walls, ornate carvings climbing all the way to the ceiling and across to the other side, light glistening off the forms and details.\n			The carvings consisted of exquisitely-detailed reproductions of machinery, cables and plates. They were similar in design to those found on the surface, though more pronounced, more ornate somehow. The structures he’d been studying atop the mountain had been made from an exquisite metal, as yet unknown to the TechArch Ministry, and by extension humanity. Such a heavy atomic substance was rare indeed out here on the galactic rim, and he suspected the previous explorers must have brought it with them. It seemed they had taken more of the material down here to decorate the walls, ceiling, and even floors with. It must have taken weeks to create all this; perhaps months or even years depending on the level of tooling used to carve the designs.\n			The room was at least a hundred feet tall, metallic imitations of cabling spidering across the vast expanse. But it almost seemed— Yes. There were real cables bolted to the ceiling, too, weaving in and out as if part of the same pattern. It led toward the other end of the room, longer lengths hanging down here and there, until it reached the throne and the giant king that occupied it.\n			The figure was humanoid in shape—two arms, two legs—all nothing but bones, now. It wore a large swath of purple; a robe of some sort, though he couldn’t scan from here to divine what it was made of. It was strange to think that even in this remote part of the galaxy, purple was still the colour of choice for royalty. Some inherent property of light, perhaps? From out the top of the garment, a huge, elongated skull poked out. It tipped back slightly, as if staring up towards the light that shone down from above.\n			There were large, mechanical installations that seemed to brace themselves to him, as if installed there by some third party. The explorers, perhaps? Three large pipes protruded from the floor, merged into one smaller channel at the knee, then thinned still until it reached the face, two offshoots splitting off to either side of the head. The central pipe flanged a little, as if shaped to the giant’s face; a breathing apparatus of some kind. Which would make the two other protrusions vents. Just like Priors and his army chaperones, it seemed the giant also needed help breathing down here to survive. Clearly, the help hadn’t been enough to save him.\n			Starting a slow walk across the great hall, Priors eyed the walls intently. It was uncanny how similar they looked to those on the surface, and yet how unique and spontaneous it all seemed.\n			The metal they used was strong stuff; it had withstood the constant barrage of sand and grit blasting across its surface for years, after all. Though with a careless knock, the material was surprisingly brittle. Priors surmised the alien species who had brought it here held it with reverence, bringing it specially to bless each and every structure, or to show special respect for a place, attaching each carved work of art to the framework, creating the very walls. It had to cost them to haul such a fragile material across the galaxy, and then spend days or weeks carving it into these ornate patterns. Priors found it odd it was the only material left behind, however. He would have thought they would take such religious artifacts with them to adorn whatever structures they built next.\n			There was little else left behind in the camp they had found. A few seemingly biological substances they may have used as a food source, though their high carbon content would have made it impossible for any human to consume without serious health consequences. There did not seem to have been any electronic device usage; no residual electromagnetic readings in the area. Nor had any discernable landing site on the entire surface been found in the weeks they had been here. How did they survive in this place without instrumentation? How did they get here in the first place? And why did they come? In fact, the only signs of intelligent life were the carvings covering every wall, every outcrop of the exotic metal, and the map they had left behind.\n			At first, the TechArch had dismissed it as a simple chunk of the exotic metal left over from the structural work, but on second inspection, it was so much more. They had somehow recreated, with remarkable accuracy, the entirety of the mountain they stood on, without any scanning device to map the area. Readings indicated there was a second part to the map, unseen from the outside. An energy signature—a spark of energy, or some sort of heat source—was trapped inside the rock. It didn’t dissipate, even in the weeks it had taken Priors to figure out what it all meant. And finally, it had led them here.\n			The energy source mapped perfectly onto this cavern-turned-cathedral. Had the explorers come all this way, only to find a huge mountain obstructing the way to their prize? Judging by the wall carvings, they must have made it this far. But just how did they get in here in the first place?\n			Military personnel milled about the foot of the giant king, Projected Computing Units showing holographic visualisations and readouts, hands pawing at the air to interact with the data. The PCU advancements weren’t from the TechArchs, but came from centuries of pure scientific endeavour. However, since mankind’s expansion into the stars, and the discovery that they were not alone in the universe, the Technological Archaeologist Ministry had discovered many other civilisations. Turned out they were all dead, which wasn’t the most encouraging news for a fledgling race venturing out into the stars, but their technology remained intact, waiting for the TechArchs to pick it up and unravel its mysteries.\n			It always amazed Priors how far ahead the rest of the galaxy seemed in some respects, and how far ahead the human species was in others. In some cases, man had even managed to pick apart the technology of these other species and repurpose it as their own. The Emers, for example, were found by TechArch Harrison on star system 591, evidently the abandoned home of an entire civilization that lived underground despite the verdant paradise that grew on the surface.\n			As he reached the feet of the statuesque giant, Priors booted up his own PCU. Light flickered in the air before him, wisps of projected manifestation appearing and disappearing like ghosts in smoke. He gazed up at the king. It was clear from here that the cables and breathing apparatus were ancient; perhaps millennia old. The special metal had not corroded, its shine only dulling to some degree; perhaps due to some oxidation-like process.\n			As he looked up further still, he squinted at the light streaming in from five distinct holes, bored into the ceiling. Each were perfect circles, and they seemed to go on forever. <em>They must lead all the way to the surface,</em> Priors thought. <em>But how?</em> Even the Emers would have trouble making such straight tunnels though so much rock and the veins of metal common in the mountain.\n			But there was something else up there, glinting in the white light. Priors stepped back a few paces, finding respite from the harsh light that lit the king and his throne. There, hanging above the giant were five glass pods. They were cylindrical in form, with rounded bottoms and reinforced with metal brackets. Dropping down from each of them were thick, black tubes, easily mistaken for more cables from a distance. They bowed out in a curve and ended at the giant, seemingly piercing his body at strategic points.\n		"),

		prose("\n			“What the—?” Priors breathed. He looked back down at the projected interface hovering in the air in front of him and began to work.\n			Priors didn’t need his hands to work an interface, holographic or otherwise. None of the TechArchs did. The neural mapping technology had come from one of the earliest discoveries the first Technological Archaeologists made. They had come across a civilisation millennia ahead of mankind. They had advanced so far ahead it took decades to decipher and repurpose the simplest of their technologies, one used for interfacing the brain with an outside computational observer… and even then it only half worked for humans.\n			There was evidence to suggest the connection was two-way for the alien species; they could input commands through thought, but could also see and hear output from a connected system in their mind, thus completing the experience. The Ministry suspected that the computers—quantum-based as they were—would have allowed this kind of super high-fidelity visual and audio output, and near-synaptic processing speeds. But for now, the TechArchs had to make do with simply controlling computers with their brains.\n			The TechArch went through the menus at super-fast pace, diving deep into the system’s capabilities. With such a fast, almost one-to-one input mechanism, he could fine-tune settings as he went, recreating the system to fit the exact requirements of his current investigation.\n			He targeted the unit’s sensors on one of the pods hanging above. It performed a spectral analysis of the materials, even picking out minor imperfections in the glass molding. There seemed to be something else, however. A material of biological origin; a few small smudges, groups of cells, dotted around the inside of the glass.\n			Priors zoomed in on the residue, the program’s interface morphing around him, unnecessary sub applications disappearing and new ones taking their place, ready for further analysis. Was that a—? It was.\n			A fingerprint, denoted by just a few long-dead cells, still clung to the inside of the glass pod. Instead of the human whorls and arches, the print showed tiny horizontal lines down the length of the fingertip. The pattern mutated towards the centre of the pad of the finger, lines wiggling and warping as if the finger had been burned, or— <em>No,</em> Priors thought. <em>It’s part of the pattern.</em> The zigzag-like pattern would give more purchase when holding objects. Fascinating…\n			The alien explorers came to the planet and set up camp on the surface, just as Priors had, presumably to investigate the king. Then they somehow made it to the middle of the mountain. Could they have made those five holes? Unlikely. They’d need miles of rope to rappel down far enough. But however they did it, the carved walls showed they revered this place. Was the king some kind of god to them? Had they made a pilgrimage across the stars to worship the giant?\n			Priors glanced back up at the pods, light refracting, sending a hint of rainbow down with the white light from above. Some of them climbed up into those things. Were they sacrifices, perhaps? There was no sign of a grisly death; no bio-material besides the fingerprints was detected. Maybe that was what the tubes were for? The king consumed them in some way through those tubes; maybe some sort of molecular disassembly like the Emers.\n			He looked back at the interface and zoomed back out from the fingerprint. This time he targeted the tubes, a little tricky as they swayed gently in the mild air currents that snaked around the throne room. He took a snapshot, all sensors capturing the same moment in time. It would be easier to analyse the data in freeze-frame.\n			The tubes seemed to be the only things in the room not made from the exotic metal, apart from the giant himself. From his readouts, the tube seemed to be made of something akin to rubber, and had tiny ridges along its length, hinting at a more complex structure below. Cutting a cross-section through the bilateral showed him the inside of the tube. Strangely, it seemed to be solid all the way through, though the rubber on the inside was less dense than that on the outside. This was clearly not just some tube used to drain the pods of their occupants. Then what could this all be <em>for</em>?\n			Priors stared up at the pods once more. They had a quiet beauty in the cool light, their tubes bobbing gently left and right, casting dancing shadows into the room. And above each of them, a perfectly round hole, leading all the way back up to the surface. Wait.\n			The TechArch looked back at the interface, wiping away the tube and its structures and bringing up an overview of the room itself, twisting the view to look down from above. It was longer than it was wide, almost rectangular with the corners rounding off unevenly. He changed the view to show the outlines of the space, as well as the five pods hanging above the king at one end. Then he zoomed out a little, outlining the holes. They matched perfectly. With the pods spaced out a few meters from each other, each bored hole was centred on its own pod, its diameter at least a third larger than that of the pod below it. Each hole cut through the mountain in a perfectly straight line, up to the surface.\n			<em>No,</em> Priors thought.<em> It couldn’t be that simple…</em> He zoomed in to one of the pods. <em>How could they have lined up so perfectly?</em> As he gazed intently at the alignment of the pod with the tunnel above it, he noticed something he hadn’t seen before. He switched views, going back to full-colour mode. There was something on top of the pod; on top of each of the pods. A covering, seemingly made of the same metal as everything else. But it didn’t look like they were simple lids. There was a curve to them—\n			He angled the view down a little, getting a three-quarter view of the construction. The metal was buckled and twisted, a barbed hole protruding from the centre, as if something had burst out of the glass chamber.\n			Priors stumbled back a couple of steps. This was unlike anything they’d seen so far. He fell back to the floor, sitting and leaning forward, sucking in the processed air from the mask. This was looking less and less like science and more like fantasy. It seemed to him the only explanation was that the explorers had found the dead king. They had carved the ornate, mechanical-looking walls, a shrine built in reverence to the giant. They then hooked up cables to the throne, perhaps to feed power to whatever apparatus they had installed around it. They hung the five glass pods, tubes hanging down and piercing the king at particular points. They then sat inside the glass chambers, flipped a switch, and consumed what life was left in the monolithic body. Its essence or power, or… <em>whatever</em>, drawn through into each of the five. And then, filled with this new power, they burst from the pods, soaring through the mountain itself, and on into the atmosphere. Perhaps they continued into space. On to a new planet to explore, with new powers to harness.\n			A half-remembered quote from a writer born centuries back floated into his mind. Maybe it was magic. Maybe magic was just technology they hadn’t reverse engineered yet. Maybe the Ministry was a group of exploring wizards, trying to remember the old tricks of the universe. All he knew was they weren’t ready to figure this one out quite yet.\n			While the commander would not be best pleased about the lack of new technology with which to better kill people, Technological Archaeologist Shawn Priors had found something that meant so much more than a simple tactical advantage. He had seen the other side of the curtain between what was possible and what was thought impossible. To know such wonders were in store for future generations of mankind to unlock was awe inspiring. He would likely never see the day this marvel was picked apart and pieced back together again. But one day…\n			Priors smiled. “Alakazam,” he muttered.\n		"),

		prose("Part 1: Coin Flip", "\n			The bell went, and the class erupted around Dustin. He didn’t get excited about the school day ending. His life didn’t begin anew after school. It just morphed into something just as boring, just as scary, or just as painful as it was during the day. He closed his eyes for a moment while the teacher hushed the class, the chaos starting to subside. He was always reminded of how pet owners torture their dogs, making them “stay” and balancing a treat on their nose. It was all about restraint. Dustin knew all about restraint.\n			As he stared into the darkness for that brief second, he started to see it once again. The vision that haunted him each and every day. Of things he had never seen. Maybe that were yet to happen… It started with a wide splotch of red. Not blood; that would come later. Then the camera pans to reveal a car, swerving to avoid the truck out of shot, but only managing to spin in place, balding tires having no purchase on the rain-slick road. Something in the tarmac catches, launching the vehicle over on its side, to begin it’s roll. The glimpse of the terrified people show them screaming, reaching for each other as the inevitable sends them forward to their destiny. Though he can see their faces he does not recognise them. The camera pans again. The truck starts to jackknife, hurtling towards the small car at ridiculous speed. The driver of the truck mirrors the horror on the faces of the soon dead. He sees what Dustin sees. He sees the end of two lives.\n			“And…” the teacher called back in the real world. Dustin opened his eyes, trying to shake off the feeling of dread and despair the vision always brought with it. “You may leave.” The kids started their frantic bustle, swinging their bags onto their shoulders as they surge towards the door. The teacher continues shouting over the cacophony, asking them to “Please remember <em>both</em> sheets of algebra for next Tuesday!” But by the time she finished her sentence the room was empty save for one kid. Dustin.\n			The woman &nbsp;turned, noticing the boy, still sitting quietly in his seat. Dustin looked up at his teacher, a solemn look on his face.\n			“Still waiting, Dustin?” she asked softly. “Don’t you want to catch up with your friends?”\n			Dustin pushed back his chair and stuffed the last books and his coat into his backpack. “Just giving them a head-start, miss…” he mumbled, pulling the straps tight and locking them shut.\n			He exited the classroom and slowly made his way down the corridor. Was she blind? He didn’t have friends. The only “friends” he had were the kind who enjoyed greeting you in the mornings by way of a swift punch to the gut. If he was lucky, the brawn would have given up waiting for him, and moved on to head home. Who was he kidding? Everyone knew Dustin was <em>anything</em> but lucky.\n			Some of the kids said he was cursed, from the spots on his face to the soles of his feet. This year alone, he’d spilled corrosive chemicals across the table in science, started wiping off the wrong side of the board in maths, and begun reading the wrong page in english-lit, and he wasn’t three weeks into the new year, yet.\n			And for some reason, the other kids of his year felt this warranted further experiment. Wasn’t curiosity a beautiful thing? Every day, the three designated leads on this scientific expedition—the kind the Nazis wouldn’t mind employing—would kindly wait for him after school with some new and colourful way to test Dustin’s amazing powers of utter lucklessness.\n			As expected, despite Dustin’s attempts at waiting them out, the three boys were dedicated to their task.\n			“Hey, Dustbin!” one of them called as Dustin exited the schools foyer entrance. He’d picked up many and various nicknames over his time at the school, but “Dustbin” seemed to be the one settled on by the masses.\n			“Well <em>howdy</em>, Dustbin!” another called. Franky started to walk towards him from the patch of grass to the side of the playground. There wasn’t any rush; they wouldn’t let him escape through the gates a dozen feet away. Franky was the ringleader of the group. He was the usual slacker in class, always getting detentions, never attending even those with any regularity.\n			Brown—called by his surname rather than his unbearable first, Francis—picked himself up off the floor behind his leader, brushing off the dust and tiny stones he’d attracted. Their lookout, Matt, stood to the side of the foyer door, cutting off Dustin’s retreat or call for help.\n			“Fancy meeting you fellas here…” Dustin said cheerily. Franky stepped in close and powered a fist into Dustin’s gut. He coughed, feeling his muscles clench too late and pain spark across his ribs. The bruises from yesterday hadn’t even yellowed yet, even as the new ones started to ache.\n			“Well, we had a nice idea, see?” Franky said without missing a beat. “Tell him, Brown.”\n			“Oh. Yeah. Well, I thought since you’re unlucky and all… we could get a coin, and then—”\n			“Watch you lose every flip,” Matt’s deeper voice chimed in from behind Dustin.\n			“So what will it be, Dustbin?” Frank continued, holding up a pound coin for Dustin to see. “Heads…” He flipped the coin round showing the other side. “Or tails?”\n			Dustin sighed. “Seriously?”\n			Franky swore. “Do I look serious to you?” He pressed the coin into his victim’s face, a grin forming on his face as he saw Dustin’s face grimace in pain.\n			Dustin broke and spoke through gritted teeth. “Then I’ll have heads. Damnit…”\n			Franky pulled the coin away and nodded, satisfied. “Then let’s see, shall we?”\n			“But… what do I get if—”\n			Ignoring Dustin, Franky flipped the coin into the air and caught it with the other hand. “Tails,” he announced in a monotone, before slamming his fist across Dustin’s face.\n			Dustin fell to the ground. He found staying standing only prolonged the pain. The sooner he was down, the sooner it was all over with and he could start gathering his strength for the slow hobble back home.\n			“Well, that’s a nice start, isn’t it?” Franky shouted, laughing maniacally. “Let’s try that again, shall we?” Before Dustin could say a word, the coin was flipped and called a second time: “Tails again.” As soon as the words were said, the second blow hit, this time from behind.\n			As Dustin tried to keep his groans to a minimum, he writhed and twisted on the ground, catching the eye of Matt who had stepped away from the double doors to get in on the action. The boy was taller than almost anyone in the school, legs like beanpoles. Whenever he cared to play footie by the bike sheds he always won the ball off of any defenders, hacking them in the shins, stepping over them as they cried in agony and chipping it lightly into the goal.\n			“Here, let’s have a go,” Brown said, grabbing the coin out of Frank’s victorious hand.\n			Brown was a shorter kid, still holding onto some puppy fat. Dustin could remember the first year of the school. A fat little boy with the name of Francis was the obvious target, and he was stomped on daily until he had some how found his way onto Frank’s team of lunatics. Though Frank would never say so himself, Brown’s heft meant he hit harder than anyone else in the year. It hadn’t made him rise in the ranks of the bully hierarchy—he just wasn’t mean enough for that—but all the bullied kids knew to stay away from Frank’s gang or get pummeled by the heaviest fist in the school.\n			Brown flicked the coin into the air, but clumsily missed it on the way down. He waited with baited breath as it bounced about on the concrete, finally clattering to a halt. <em>Come on,</em> Dustin pleaded to himself. <em>One time…</em>\n			“Yay! Tails!” Brown called, letting out a giggle with boyish glee, swooping down with his giant meat fist and slamming it hard in Dustin’s side.\n			“Oh… come on, guys,” Dustin muttered between choking coughs. “What’s even the point of this?”\n			“What’s the point?” Frank asked, a sneer wrinkling his face. “The point is, you’re the most unlucky sod this school’s ever seen.” He grinned, and put on a cutesy, babying voice. “And you’re fun to play with.”\n			“You’re only having fun because there are no stakes,” Dustin said, doing his best to control his breathing and stay steady. “What are you, chicken?”\n			It was a coin. No matter what the kids said, he wasn’t cursed. There was a fifty-fifty chance of landing a heads, and there had been three tails already! There had to be a good chance of heads next time. The universe did <em>not</em> bend to his whim.\n			Brown let out a staccato laugh, but a stern look from Frank shut him up quick. Franky turned back to his prey, cowering on the ground. “Like you have anything to bet with…”\n			Dustin looked around the ground, trying to think of something he could barter with. “I… I guess…” There was only one thing he could give these low-lifes. They wanted their pound of flesh? Then that was what he’d give them. “I’ll give you me.”\n			“What?” Frank said, a stupid look on his face.\n			“Tails, you win first dibs. Every day. After school. I’m yours. No question.” Was he really doing this? This was insanity. Dustin breathed in deep to calm his nerves; strengthen his resolve.“And heads you leave me alone. For good.” He looked up into Frank’s eyes. The boy still looked perplexed. As perplexed as Dustin felt, inside.\n			A low laugh came from behind Dustin, and he rolled over to look at Matt. “The kid’s got spunk. Why not?” Matt said with a shrug.\n			Frank let out a laugh of his own, still unsure. “Yeah… sure. Why not?”\n			“And how about this?” Matt continued. “You get to toss the coin.”\n			“But it’s my—” Franky started.\n			“<em>He</em> gets to toss the coin,” Matt interrupted, a command to his voice Dustin had only ever heard once or twice, booming across a busy playground. Did he think this was some kindness, to torture Dustin with having his own fate in his hands? They all knew it would land tails, just as sure as the rain fell when he forgot his coat last week and his coursework was ruined by a leaky bottle the week before that.\n			“Yeah,” Franky said, looking down at Dustin, eyes still unsure what was going on. “Yeah, let the guinea pig do it. It won’t change nothin’.”\n			He scraped the pound across the concrete to Dustin, and Dustin took it, sitting up on the ground. He closed his eyes, rubbing the cold metal between his fingers. He took short breaths and pushed out the air. Starting to feel himself welling up, he shook his head and clenched his jaw.\n			“Is… is he crying?” Brown mumbled curiously.\n			Dustin continued his controlled breathing and put himself somewhere else. He wasn’t here, being beaten to a pulp on the whim of a coin. He was walking home, happy in the knowledge no one was out to get him. Safe in his own skin. Confident in his ability to lead a perfectly normal life. The terrible vision could not reach him in this other place. He had denied the premonition and took hold of his destiny with both hands.\n			One last, deep breath… hold it… and then out.\n			Dustin opened his eyes and flipped the coin. It spun high into the air before soaring down in a shallow arc. He didn’t even hold out his hand to catch it; just stared at it as it zipped down towards the concrete.\n			It bounced once. Twice. Then skittered across the tarmac, ricocheting off the uneven surfaces, rolling closer and closer to a nearby drain. And then with a soft thud, it fell in, landing in amongst the dead leaves and moss that grew in the shallow gutter.\n			Dustin looked up at Franky. Franky looked down at Dustin. Both boys swore under their breath. “You bloody bastard! Your bad luck jumped to the coin! You owe me a quid now, don’t ya?” The boy landed a kick in Dustin’s chest, landing him flat on his back once more.\n			Dustin thought he heard a crack as his world shuddered, vision blurring as he tried to catch his breath. He barely felt the slew of kicks and punches the three laid into him, the punishment starting to dull his senses against the pain. He held onto his backpack tight, steeling himself for what he felt could be the end of it all…\n			“Ow!” a voice cried. Dustin opened an eye, still wincing at the sharp ache across his body and legs. “My toe! My bloody toe!” Franky yelped, collapsing to the ground, clutching at his leg in agony.\n			Brown, good boy as he was, rushed to his friend’s side. He looked back at Dustin wide eyes, tears welling in the corners. “He really is cursed. His giving us his bad luck!”\n			Matt walked around Dustin, looking down at his fallen comrade’s foot. “What’s the matter, Frank?” he said in his deep, rumbling voice.\n			“I think it’s broke!” Frank responded through gritted teeth. “Must’ve caught it on his damn buckle or something.”\n			The taller boy looked over at Dustin, eyeing him suspiciously. The strap on the backpack had a small plastic buckle for adjustment, but it surely wasn’t hard enough to… was it? “No. No, you did something, Dustin,” Matt muttered, a scared look on his face. “You led us on and then you did something to his foot! I’m… I’m getting a teacher!”\n			“But Matt—” Brown objected.\n			“Stay there and don’t let him move,” Matt replied, pointing to Dustin and moving hurriedly toward the foyer doors.\n			At that moment, the boy’s foot struck a rock, sending him flying. His body hit the ground with a hard crunch, tiny stones quickly skittering away from the impact.\n			Brown looked up at his colleague in arms. “Matt?” he said, weakly. Matt did not move. Dustin rolled over to see the boy, strewn on the floor and out cold. Must have hit his head on the concrete. That was going to hurt in the morning.\n			“I think he’s passed out,” Dustin said, turning to look at the third bully.\n			“You— You did it!” Brown stuttered.\n			“I didn’t touch him,” Dustin said, pushing himself up off of the ground to a sitting position, wincing as his bones moved and shot hot pain up his spine.\n			“Did too!” Franky snapped back. “It’s your luck that got him!” The boy waved a finger in Dustin’s direction, though his hand shook from fear.\n			Dustin sniggered, triggering more pain, though he smiled through it. Reaching forward, he forced himself back to his feet despite complaints from his ribs and knee. The laugh came again, pleasure mixed with pain, and he started the long stagger home.\n			When he reached the gate, he looked back. Still not a teacher in sight. They’d leave Matt on the ground, most likely. It was that or ‘fess up to what they’d been up to in the playground, after school, with Dustin “Dustbin” Crewe, known victim of the whole damn school. So Dustin turned and continued out of the school.\n			Though this morning he wished he could bring himself to tell someone, he was okay that no one would know what had happened today. He didn’t need the teachers to save him, now. Didn’t need his parents to notice something was wrong. He’d taken hold of his own destiny. He’d won, off his own back against three of the meanest, no good, evil blighters in the area.\n			He had always felt like something bad would happen to him. Maybe the vision would come true one day, maybe he was just going to get beat up every day after school, the bell tolling his impending turmoil. This was the first time he’d dared to hope of more. To dream of something other than death and terror. It was the first time he’d seen happiness and contentment in his future.\n			<em>I guess the universe answered,</em> Dustin thought, tears streaking down his cheeks. He let them wet his face, let his jaw slack and tighten, soaking up the physical pain, the mental anguish. He breathed a deep, sobbing breath, and let out all the fear, all the anger, all the regret. Now he was in control of his own destiny.\n\n			Half an hour later, Matt came to. Rousing from his dreamless sleep, he pulled himself up off the ground, feeling at his temple to find a bulging bruise. What would his dad say when he found out? It was the belt for him, for sure.\n			Looking around at the playground in the dying light, he saw a few drops of blood in another spot. Dustin. That was right. It was that kid’s flip, and coin—\n			Matt stumbled across to the grating embedded in the concrete, and peered carefully into the gutter. There, in the bed of dead leaves and scummy moss lay a pound coin, the queen’s head glinting in the moonlight.\n		"),
		prose("Part 2: Leap of Faith", "\n			Dustin stepped up to the edge, carefully peering over into the 300 foot drop beyond. He wasn’t the type to get vertigo, but still felt his hands shake as he stared down at the ground. Of course, the fact that half the casino owners in Las Vegas wanted him dead had him on edge already. But what a week it had been…\n			The boy looked across the rooftop, contemplating his fate. They would know where he was by now; they were probably making their way up the building already. Simply waiting for them was sure to end in broken legs if he was lucky, a broken face if he wasn’t. The casinos did not take kindly to fifteen year olds sneaking into their establishment and sneaking out with a couple hundred thousand dollars of winnings. Do this a few more times, and you've managed to get on the wrong side of an entire city’s worth of pit bosses.\n			Dustin looked back down at the shimmering, mirrored surface of the building. It was quite beautiful from this angle, but he wondered what it would look like when he was zipping past at terminal velocity.\n			A gust of wind blasted through him, pushing him back behind the lip of the roof and sending him toppling to the ground. He'd never been so high up in his life; not outside, anyway. It was amazing how nature had its way of giving subtle hints that it doesn’t want you there. Deep under water nature crushed you like a pimple under a sledgehammer. High up and it’ll do its darndest to blow you off whatever peak you’d managed to scale.\n			But maybe that was it. People fell off tall buildings and got saved by gusts of wind, right? He was sure he'd read that somewhere. Just a pinch of Kismet, drop a few dozen floors, and get smashed through a window. Painful, no doubt, but needs must.\n			It was a big ask, though. No matter how hard he’d tried since he discovered his power, it didn’t seem to be quite as fine-tuned as he’d like it to be. Wishing for a specific series of events never quite worked as intended, and for something as unlikely as this was, with so many ways for it all to go horribly wrong, it wasn't even worth trying.\n			Everything seemed to hinge on the feeling, rather than the order of events. The first time his Kismet kicked in, all he had was a wish for a better life, and that worked out just fine. But how do you really test something so… fuzzy? Could it really be as simple as that? To just want to be safe, and the universe would fill in the rest?\n			Two muffled shots resounded across the flat roof, and Dustin instinctively ducked down. The wooden door splintered, crumbling apart as four men in black suits burst onto the rooftop. Two of them had guns.\n			<em>Crap,</em> Dustin thought. <em>Crap, crap, crap!</em>\n			He quickly scrambled to a low air-conditioning unit that jutted out from the flat roof. He leaned up against it, trying to catch his breath. They were here already. This was really happening.\n			Dustin looked across at the black duffle bag. The one full of money. Why’d he even bring it up here? They were going to see it for sure.\n			“Look!” a deep, gravelly voice boomed. “A bag!”\n			<em>That damned Kismet!</em> Dustin thought, biting his lip.\n			That was the one thing he wasn't such a fan of with his newfound power. Having the universe pay attention to your thoughts and feelings didn't play so well if you weren't feeling that optimistic.\n			<em>Okay. So what now?</em> They knew he was here, they were on their way over to him, and they had loaded, fully-working, definitely-not-toy guns. Only one thing <em>to</em> do.\n			Dustin popped up from behind his cover. Ignoring the shouts of alarm from the four men, he started in a run towards the roof’s edge, grabbing the bag as he went. And with a deep breath, he closed his eyes and leapt into the air.\n			“Kismet” means fate. Or something. Dustin had never quite read enough about it to be sure, but it sounded cool, and so that was the name he used for his superpower. It seemed to him everyone was born with some amount of Kismet. Most people didn’t have much, or if they did, they put it down to blind luck or coincidence.\n			Dustin didn't know any of this, of course—he had nothing to go on but his own experiences—but it all felt about right, and over the years since he discovered his gift, he'd learned to trust his instincts on this stuff.\n			Dustin also guessed this was why there was an age limit for gambling. Get some punk kid who had a decent amount of Kismet and knew how to use it, and your casino would go bankrupt in a single night. So why take the risk? Lucky for Dustin, he was tall for his age. He just walked in like he owned the place, and it all just seemed to work out fine. Until he found himself plummeting from a hundred story building towards a sticky end, of course.\n			<em>No. Mustn't think like that,</em> Dustin thought. <em>Have to keep focused.</em> He'd be fine. He didn't know what would happen, or the probability of his survival, but with a little concentration, he could start to <em>feel</em> it. He could feel the relief of escaping the casinos and their lynch mob. He could feel happy he'd made it out alive and intact. And—why not?—he could feel the reassuring weight of the bag of money in his hand.\n			In that instant, a sudden gust caught the bag, ripping it from his grasp. <em>Fine,</em> Dustin thought. <em>Screw the money. Just get me out of this alive!</em>\n			 He could sense his body spinning slowly in the air, until his was plummeting head first towards the ground. His lips started to flap against his face, as though someone was wobbling his cheeks at a rate of knots. It kinda tickled.\n			He let out a staccato laugh. But as he did so, his jaw was wrenched open, air shoving its way into his mouth. It was an odd feeling, not being able to breathe when so much oxygen was slamming into your face. Dustin tried desperately to close his jaw while sucking in air through his nose at a more manageable rate. But it was no use. He felt his head lighten, time seeming to slow in a prolonged torture.\n			<em>Come on,</em> Dustin thought. <em>I'm being as positive as I can here, but you've gotta kick in soon, or else—</em>\n			A second gust interrupted his train of thought. His body lurched to one side. Dustin scrunched his eyes up ever tighter. He just hoped he was being flung towards the building and not further out over the streets below.\n			The sound changed somehow, the loud, bellowing air stream quieting down on one side of him. Did that mean he was nearing the windows? If all went according to plan he was going to break through one of the extra thick plate glass. He just hoped it wouldn't break <em>him</em> in the process. He brought back the feelings once more, making them clearer and clearer in his mind. He'd make it. He had to.\n			A third gust blew, this time from below, slowing his descent. And suddenly, all was quiet. The blast of air was reduced to a light whistle somewhere off to his left, and his ears rang from the abuse they’d had to withstand. How long had he been falling for? Minutes? Hours?\n			After a time, he sensed a weight beneath him. It was his weight. Had he stopped? His body, his hands and fingers all felt numb from the lack of oxygen, and a dull throbbing ached inside his head.\n			He opened his eyes. There was a carpet beneath him, stretching off down the corridor. He could feel the deep red shag between his fingers now. As he pulled himself up a nearby wall, he noticed the doors at regular intervals down the hall, their shiny keycard readers glinting in the fluorescent lights above.\n			But where was the broken glass? Was he so out of it he couldn't feel the pain of the impact?\n			Dustin turned and stared at a square hole in the side of the building, floor to ceiling, wall to wall. Lucky for him, they must've been working on this floor; replacing the pane of glass for whatever reason. And there, sitting just on the edge of the floor, sat a bag, still full of money, waiting for him to collect it.\n			He staggered towards it, picking it up with a sigh. He felt the weight of it in his hand. It was just as he imagined.\n		"),
		prose("Part 3: Kismet", "\n			Dustin entered the casino. It was quiet for an afternoon, but being hidden down some back-alley, it wasn’t destined to be the hottest spot in the city. He paused for a moment, taking in a deep breath. <em>It’ll all go according to plan,</em> he reassured himself. <em>Everything will be fine. It always is.</em>\n			Striding forward confidently, the boy listened as the door closed itself behind him. After a moment to let his eyes adjust to the cold casino lights, he eyed the tables carefully. The place looked good on the surface, but on closer inspection it was showing signs of wear and tear. The wallpaper peeling in a corner, the wood facing showing scratches, revealing the chipboard beneath. It had been the same in the other places he’d visited. He targeted the off-piste establishments; not so underground as to be dangerous, but not too popular either. The room had pockets of gamblers hunched over tables here and there, a few of the unlucky ones nursing beers and whiskeys over at the bar.\n			Stuck to the mirror behind the barkeep was a sign that said ‘Strictly over 18s only!’ in bold white-on-red letters. Of course, Dustin knew why such laws were in place. The Kismet was strongest when you were a baby, and tended to trail off as you aged and got more familiar with the general crappiness the world offered. It was strongest when you’re born; stronger still if you birth was dramatic… a tragedy like your mother dying in childbirth would grant you extra-special ability.\n			Dustin wasn’t that lucky, though. Born to average parents that never really understood their son, his birth had been an averagely joyous occasion for them; not much drama to be had, unfortunately. He did have the luck to notice the gift, though. In all his searching, he had not found one other kid talking about his amazing luck; his ability to know… to really <em>believe</em> a thing would happen, the universe answering by granting the wish. Some called such things fate; coincidence; quaint happenstance that no one could control. He called it his Kismet.\n			The familiar sound of a roulette ball spinning resounded across the room, followed by the clatter of it settling into a slot, cheers and groans coming from the onlookers. It drew him closer. There were ten or so people crowded round the table, with four players scraping their chips to themselves and then placing their next bets. The larger crowd would make it easier to quietly watch as he prepared.\n			When he had joined the group there was a small, middle-aged man standing just in front of Dustin. The man wore a white shirt and scruffy tweed trousers held up by suspenders, like in a cartoon. Every so often he’d dab his forehead with a handkerchief, mopping at the droplets of nervous sweat that formed there. <em>He isn’t doing so well,</em> Dustin guessed. <em>The perfect mark.</em>\n			“Are you playing again, sir?” the croupier asked politely.\n			“Er… yes,” the man spluttered, looking down in dismay at his few remaining chips. Looked like he was down to twenty or thirty pounds. Leaning across the table, he placed his last chips on 31.\n			“You sure, Joe?” another man chided, a skinny, haggard woman on his arm. “Don’t want to quit while you’re ahead?” His voice was slimy, matching his slicked-back hair and pointy grin perfectly. Dustin felt a shiver bolt down his spine.\n			The older man just shivered and leant hard against the table, knuckles white as they gripped the edging and eyes shut tight as if to brace himself for the inevitable.\n			“And… rolling!” the croupier called out, launching the ball around the opposite way to the spinner. Dustin started preparing.\n			The way Kismet worked was simple. You didn’t need to make a wish, or rub some trinket while saying the magic words. Instead all Dustin had to do was imagine, as vividly as possible, the feeling of a thing happening. What would it be like for such-and-such a thing to happen? How would it feel? What would the atmosphere be like? Keep that in your mind’s eye well enough and the universe would slowly come round to the idea that it should grant you that feeling for real.\n			And so, Dustin knew the ball would land true. He could imagine the look on the man’s face; could see the chips being dished out and the gentleman happily pulling them back towards himself. He looked at the floor and focussed on that feeling, wincing as he waited for the sound to announce the ball had landed.\n			A bounce, a second, and… with a clatter the ball had chosen.\n			“Well, what do you know, Joe?” the slimy man chirped.\n			“What?” the older man said, in disbelief. “I… won?”\n			The crowd to either side of him cheered and patted him on the shoulder. Dustin dodged the flailing arms to stay out of the spotlight, but he couldn’t help a smile. It was a by-product of his plan, but it always felt good to give someone a little happiness in these soulless places of torment.\n			“Congratulations, sir,” the croupier said with a nod, dishing out the winnings and helping the man pull them off of the board. “Maybe your luck is turning around?” he said with a thin smile. Dustin hated that. The way the house players manipulated the customers and gave their false praise. Having bet on a single number, the man had won somewhere around £500 in one hit. If the house was going to win it back, the man would have to lose. And to lose he would have to keep playing. The whole thing made his skin crawl.\n			“Er… yeah,” the older man said, shakily. “Yeah, I think I will.” He shoved his winnings back onto the board, piling it up haphazardly on the thirteen spot.\n			<em>Great,</em> Dustin thought. <em>Now I’ve got that to contend with.</em> There wasn’t any real curse on the number thirteen; Dustin’s Kismet was largely unaffected by the number whenever it cropped up. The problem was that everyone ‘knows’ that thirteen is unlucky and, whether consciously or unconsciously, they have trouble not thinking it’s all going to go horribly wrong in some way. Especially with the gambling crowd. Not only would Dustin have to overcome his own worries about the bet’s outcome… his Kismet was up against everyone else’s superstition.\n			“And… rolling!” the croupier called, shooting the ball round the wheel once more.\n			<em>Okay. Here goes nothing,</em> Dustin thought, closing his eyes and balling his hands into fists. He could see the man weeping with joy, throwing chips into the air. The crowd going wild and the croupier looking like he’d sucked a lemon. Now that was a nice image.\n			Dustin listened as the ball bounced once, twice, a third time, and then stopped. He opened an eye tentatively. “And that’s a thirteen!” the croupier announced. Dustin opened his eyes and felt the people to either side of him jostle him to and fro. The crowd had grown a little now, everyone smiling and reaching for the man in front of him, trying to snatch at his luck. Little did they know he had a little help.\n			He grinned, looking around at the smiling faces. He did that. It was all thanks to him. Now if the old man didn’t blow it on another bet—\n			Dustin caught the eye of a bouncer, standing quietly, back to the wall ahead of him. He was around 5’ 9”, but packed a lot of muscle under his perfectly tailored tux. The man stared back, unflinching. Dustin hadn’t noticed the man before; the walls were poorly lit at the end of the room, and he stood strategically to be almost invisible to anyone not looking for him until it was too late and stepped out of the shadows to throw some poor sucker out on his ear.\n			Dustin felt something catch in his throat and swallowed hard. <em>I have to get this done,</em> he thought. <em>That bouncer won’t stand there for long if he thinks there’s any foul play.</em>\n			“Wow!” Dustin said heartily, slapping the man ahead of him on the back, watching the man’s winnings get shovelled across the table. “Well played, old man! I hope you don’t mind if I get in on the action at this juncture?” <em>Adults say juncture, right?</em> Dustin thought hopefully.\n			“Oh… No, no, I don’t mind, sir,” the man replied uncertainly.\n			“Ah! There’s a good chap,” Dustin continued. Pushing through the crowd to the table, he brought his bag onto the edge and brought out a couple of bundles of money. Two thousand pounds. “So… two-k on thirteen?” he said, turning to the croupier.\n			“Chips for two thousand, sir?”\n			“Oh, I’m sorry,” Dustin said, glancing down at his watch. “I’m kind of late for my flight. Would just cash be okay? You can count it; it’s all there…”\n			The croupier looked unsure and called over the floor manager for the establishment. They spoke for a moment in hushed tones. They’d agree. Losing tens of thousands of pounds in a single sitting wasn’t their style, and a big bet like this would start making it back.\n			“I’m sorry I can’t stay for too long. Just one little bet before I hit the road again, eh?”\n			The manager stepped back and the croupier said, “Very well, sir. We’ll take your bet. We’ll ready your potential winnings as we spin the wheel, if that is agreeable?”\n			Dustin nodded. It was all going according to plan… “Sounds good to me, young man!” <em>Too much?</em>\n			The croupier spun the wheel and readied the ball. “Then everyone, please place your bets!” he called. One or two others put their chips onto the board, some even joining the man’s bet on 13. <em>Maybe their optimism will make this a little easier to pull off,</em> Dustin thought, sliding his bundles of notes across the table.\n			“And… rolling!” the croupier chirped.\n			As the ball rolled around the outer edge of the wheel, Dustin felt his pulse race, adrenaline pumping through his body, heart thudding in his chest. He would make this. He’d take his winnings. He’d walk out of here soft and easy.\n			The ball snagged on a spike, ricocheting into the air. Hitting a second spike, the ball started skittering over the slots, threatening to land at any moment. “Yes!” Dustin muttered, slamming a fist into the padded table edging. He would make it! He could see it all come together! It became real to him!\n			The ball stopped bouncing. The crowd held their breath.\n			“And that’s a thirteen!” the croupier announced, a look of unease on his face. The crowd cheered, players and spectators raising their glasses in jubilation.\n			“Wow!” Dustin exclaimed with a sigh. “Lucky number thirteen, huh?”\n			The older man to his side embraced Dustin in a mighty bear-hug, squeezing the air out of his lungs.\n			The manager stepped forward, wheeling a short table in front that held a pile of money. “Should we load your winnings into the bag sir,” he asked, “or are you willing to take another gamble?” His face was hopeful, hands wringing, beads of sweat gathering across his forehead.\n			“I don’t think I’ll tempt fate a fourth time,” Dustin said happily. “I think I’ll quit while I’m ahead, if you don’t mind.”\n			The bouncer moved then, stepping away from the wall, the cold lights glinting off of his bald head. Why is he—?\n			“Very well, sir,” the manager said, dejected. Two attendants stepped forward and started loading his bag with his new 70 grand or so. Not bad for a day’s work. He’d had more in the past, but with more winnings comes more suspicion. He guessed he could probably take down a casino in a single night, but that would bring the heat for sure.\n			No; one hit was enough to tide him over for now.\n			“And that’s £74,000 to you, sir,” the manager said, zipping up the duffel bag, the bundles of money fitting nice and snug inside. “Very well played.”\n			Dustin nodded his thanks and picked up the bag, the weight reassuring on his shoulder. “Well thank you very much for the fun,” he said. Then, turning to the man to his side, he continued, “And thank <em>you</em>, sir, for your winning streak.” They shook hands, the older man grinning crazily, tears in his eyes.\n			Dustin turned then, starting towards the door once more. He could feel himself start to breathe again. It felt like he had held his breath for so long he could burst. He breathed in deep, doing his best to keep it slow and controlled. He couldn’t let his cool facade slip now.\n			It didn’t matter, now, if they figured out his gift or not. He was allowed to gamble and even win a substantial amount of money from them, all the while being underage. Dustin knew the law was there to stop kids like him, their in-born Kismet still fresh, from destroying gambling dens in one sitting… but it would serve <em>him</em>, now. If they brought any legal action to him—tried to sue him for the money or have him thrown into jail—they’d have to pay the fines for allowing a minor to play their tables. That, plus the scandal in the papers would bring the place down as surely as if he’d gambled them into bankruptcy himself. He was home-free.\n			“Congratulations, sir,” the barman called as he passed.\n			“Thanks, man,” Dustin said, his boyish vocabulary coming back now he was relaxing. As he glanced at the man, he saw something in the mirror behind him. The bouncer was following; not so close as to be obvious, but trailing along behind. Why was he so suspicious? He hadn’t given him any cause for concern, had he? He was just some guy who came in, watched a couple of games and then—\n			But wait. He’d said he’d tempted fate <em>three</em> times. But he had only played the once. Maybe the bouncer had realised something was up, or maybe Dustin’s slip-up just hung about the man’s subconscious, telling him something wasn’t right. Either way, if the bald, well-built man caught up with him, it wouldn’t be long before his true age would be discovered.\n			<em>Keep calm,</em> Dustin thought, frantically. <em>Everything will be okay if you just keep calm…</em>\n			Crashing against the door, he swung it out wide into the dark night air, then started a brisker pace across the forecourt and on into the street. He heard the door open a second time, squeaky hinges betraying his pursuer. He daren’t look back. He looked back now and all was lost.\n			Starting across the quiet back-alley road, Dustin closed his eyes. Walking blind, he clenched his fists and trusted it would all be okay. He could feel the relief of realising the bouncer was no longer following. He could see himself relaxing in the tub of some hotel penthouse suite, safe in the knowledge the bald man would never bother him ever again. He felt his neck relax, despite the heavy load. His hands opened, and he breathed deep once more.\n			Slowly, Dustin opened his eyes, stepping up onto the curb in front of him. It was then he became aware of a peculiar sound. Almost like tires—\n			Quickly spinning on a heel, he watched in horror as an articulated truck barrelled down the road towards his follower.\n			“What the—” the bald man cried, staring in awe at the truck that seemingly came out of nowhere.\n			As the juggernaut-like vehicle bore down the street it slammed into cars parked on the other side of the street, pushing over lampposts and phone polls. Why on earth would such a huge lorry decide to venture down such a small side road? It was nonsensical. There was no logical explanation.\n			“Look ou—” Dustin cried, reaching a hand out towards the man.\n			But it was too late. In a split second, the truck slammed into the man, tires screeching to no avail. The man’s ragdoll body flew down the road, skimming across the tarmac like the ball skittered across the numbers.\n			Dustin turned and felt his knees weaken. He bent double and sucked in air hard and fast. “What… The… Hell…” A spark of realisation hit him as hard as the truck had hit that poor man. “No,” he said, desperately. “No, no, no, no, no…”\n			It was him. The bouncer would never bother him again. He was home-free. He could go to that penthouse suite and soak in that bath as long as he want, his fears leeching away. He had nothing to worry about now. No suspicion that could come back and bite him. No repercussion for his actions. No consequences. Just how he always thought it would be.\n			Wiping away tears, Dustin stood up straight, breathing in the cold night air, feeling the burn in his lungs. He closed his eyes once more. He could see himself forgetting about this… accident. For that’s all it was. He would go on living his life knowing he had nothing to do with it. No guilt. No worry. He was rich now, after all… wasn’t he?\n		")

He glanced down at the small plaque in front of the object. “The first random-access memory drive,” it said, in tiny letters. “RAM?” Toby said. He’d heard the term in history a few weeks back. The class had gone to the exhibit to see these archaic machines, though such old tech didn’t interest Toby. “But why would you make storage you can’t talk to?”\n			“I am not sure, Toby,” AI said. “I shall try connecting to it, and monitor for signs of activity. Perhaps it has a faulty data-out mechanism.”\n			“Good idea,” Toby said.\n			“Scanning…” AI said, before growing silent.\n			Toby started to wander along the wide case, looking at all the machines and parts sitting inside. <em>How do they keep the dust off?</em> he thought.\n			“Any luck so far, AI?” Toby asked.\n			He waited a few seconds, but no reply came.\n			“AI? Are you functional?”\n			Still no reply.\n			Toby felt his heart begin to race, thumping in his chest. How would he find his way back to the teacher with no GPS? Who would tell him when he should start back to the school bus? He’d get left behind.\n			“AI!” Toby pleaded. “Talk to me!” He spun, looking wildly about the room, hoping for someone he recognised. No one’s social tags were showing; they were all just strangers to him now. No one was going to step forward. He was lost.\n			Tears blurring his vision, Toby ran from the room, calling for his teacher and friends.\n\n			A small boy ran from the IT History exhibit of the National History Museum. He scuffed past a sign, too tall for him to notice before. It showed the AI icon—a pixelated brain—with it broken in two. Below, it read: “Please turn off your AI before entering this exhibit.”\n		")
