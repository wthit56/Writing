                <p>The horses became uneasy as the pair neared the clearing. It had taken them five days to trek through the forest, its undergrowth dense through centuries of undisturbed leisure, its tendrils thick and cumbersome underfoot. Even the great horses of Ander found it hard to press onward through the foliage, and they did not have even those to carry them on their journey. The two riders had dismounted to gain better purchase on the forest floor, picking their way through the maze-like woods.</p>
                <p>Jent looked up at the massive tree ahead of them, still visible through the dense canopy. The forest was well known for its giant trees, each with girth even a family of woodsmen could not encompass, and stretching so far in the air a ship could be built stem-to-stern in long, uncut planks cut from the tree. It was said that during the war for the Wide Sea of Prote half the forest was chopped down, each tree made into its own ship. Thanks fully Jent was born long after such troubled times.</p>
